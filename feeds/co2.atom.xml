&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is also available in &lt;a href="http://sustainsubstance.org/nl/co2footprint.html"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;, and as &lt;a href="//sustainsubstance.org/offline/sustainsubstance-20160422-co2_and_the_average_you.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; or ebook (&lt;a href="//sustainsubstance.org/offline/sustainsubstance-20160422-co2_and_the_average_you.epub"&gt;EPUB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="//sustainsubstance.org/offline/sustainsubstance-20160422-co2_and_the_average_you.azw3"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt;) for offline reading.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, on Earth day, &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/04/what-exactly-is-going-to-happen-at-the-climate-signing-ceremony-on-22-april/"&gt;countries will start signing the Paris climate treaty&lt;/a&gt; that was reached last December by the representatives of 195 countries. A lot has already been said and written about this Paris Agreement, which in 2020 should succeed the venerable 1997 Kyoto protocol.&lt;sup id="fnref:cop21"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cop21"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
While the agreement is a great step forward, we&amp;rsquo;re certainly not there yet. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work ahead for governments, civil society and the private sector. The key to controlling global warming basically lies in &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/16/new-form-climate-denialism-dont-celebrate-yet-cop-21"&gt;keeping government-owned fossil fuel reserves in the ground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/16/new-form-climate-denialism-dont-celebrate-yet-cop-21"&gt;and halting the exploration of new reserves by private companies.&lt;/a&gt; This is possible, but not exactly trivial given the huge economic interests involved and the significant challenges inherent in transitioning to a new energy system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/co2.html"&gt;In an earlier article&lt;/a&gt; I described why it is important to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, even if you&amp;rsquo;re sceptical about the warnings of an impending climate apocalypse.&lt;sup id="fnref:co2importance"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:co2importance"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Recognising that something should probably be done to reduce emissions is an important step, one that our governments finally seem to have taken. But the more difficult problem is really: how do we do that? Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is much easier said than done. For the most part, they are caused by the burning of fossil fuels to meet our energy requirements. If we want to reduce these emissions, we will need two things: alternative energy sources and more efficient use of energy.&lt;sup id="fnref:energy"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:energy"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Governments will no doubt play an important role in reducing emissions, but the role of citizens and companies will probably be at least as important, if not more so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An average person exhales roughly a kilogram (2.2 lbs) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per day.&lt;sup id="fnref:farts"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:farts"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On top of that however, our activities are responsible for the emission of a lot more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gasses. For instance, my home country of The Netherlands is a relatively wealthy Western European country, with a high standard of living, and therefore a high energy requirement. In fact, the activities of an average Dutch person cause the equivalent of around &lt;strong&gt;46 kilograms&lt;/strong&gt; (100 lbs) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be emitted every day! This is more than our &lt;a href="http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;amp;PA=81565NED&amp;amp;D1=3-4,6&amp;amp;D2=a&amp;amp;D3=5&amp;amp;D4=0&amp;amp;D5=34&amp;amp;HDR=G1,T&amp;amp;STB=G2,G4,G3&amp;amp;VW=T"&gt;average body weight&lt;/a&gt; every two days. In some cases we emit this CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly, for instance when burning gasoline, diesel or natural gas in our car or heating system. Sometimes someone else emits it for us, some distance away, for instance if we use electricity or take a plane. Very often however, our emissions are indirect, and often even occur outside of our own country. This happens when we buy things that cost energy to produce. Sometimes &lt;em&gt;a lot of&lt;/em&gt; energy, as we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below shows the daily greenhouse gas emission for an average consumer in the Netherlands (click on the figure for more details):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="display: block; margin: 30px 0; width: 80vw; margin-left: 50%; -webkit-transform: translateX(-50%); -moz-transform: translateX(-50%); -ms-transform: translateX(-50%); -o-transform: translateX(-50%); transform: translateX(-50%);"&gt;
&lt;a href="//sustainsubstance.org/pages/ghg-consumption-nl.html"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/carbon-footprint-consumption-nl.png" alt="greenhouse gas emissions from average consumption in NL"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;rsquo;d like to say two things about these numbers. These are &lt;em&gt;estimates&lt;/em&gt;, based on two different studies, done using data from 2000 and 2001. These numbers are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; exact measurements, and results from various studies rarely match exactly. And yes, the data is 15 years old, unfortunately I could not find more recent numbers at this level of detail. Undoubtedly some things will have changed since the start of the millennium, which would cause some minor shifts in these figures. But I don&amp;rsquo;t expect drastic changes in consumption or emission over this period. More importantly, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter if the numbers are a bit off, as I aim to look at large-scale trends here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to note is that these are numbers for an &amp;ldquo;average Dutch person&amp;rdquo;. This average person, however, does not exist. It is a theoretical construct of indeterminate age and sex, with no clear place of residence. Or to put it another way, the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; emissions will be different for everyone, and the numbers quoted here will apply to nobody exactly. If you&amp;rsquo;re vegan and do not own a car, your average daily CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emission will easily be 10 kg below average. But if you eat meat three times a day and drive around in a big SUV or fly to a different continent four times a year, your emissions can easily be several times the average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So within a country, the differences in emission between people can be quite large. But &lt;em&gt;between different countries&lt;/em&gt; the differences can sometimes be enormous. The average American emits one and a half times as much as the average Dutch person. The average Chinese on the other hand causes around five times &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; greenhouse-emissions than the average Dutch consumer, even though China, with its enormous population and industry, is often named as the biggest polluter. The reason for this apparent contradiction is simple: Chinese consumers (on average) buy less, travel less and use less energy than those in the West. However, the Chinese industry produces a lot of the stuff we buy. Therefore much of the emission in China &lt;em&gt;as a country&lt;/em&gt; is for making &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; consumption goods. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from Chinese factories and power plants is mostly part of &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; indirect emissions in the West. The more well-off a country&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants, the more greenhouse gasses are emitted directly and indirectly to support their lifestyle. One average Dutch person emits as much greenhouse gas as 4 Brazilians, 10 people in India or 23 people in Malawi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="display: block; margin: 30px 0; width: 80vw; margin-left: 50%; -webkit-transform: translateX(-50%); -moz-transform: translateX(-50%); -ms-transform: translateX(-50%); -o-transform: translateX(-50%); transform: translateX(-50%);"&gt;
&lt;a href="//sustainsubstance.org/pages/carbon-footprint-countries.html"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/carbon-footprint-consumption-countries.png" alt="greenhouse gas emissions from average consumption in various countries"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see in the figure above, The Netherlands is fairly representative of rich Western European countries when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. So, if we assume that being poor is not the preferred way to mitigate climate change, what would be the most effective way to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions? To determine this, it is useful to look at the numbers in a bit more detail. Which things contribute most to our emissions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above figures, I have divided consumption-related emissions into five main categories. Generally the smallest of these represents the emissions from constructing houses and other buildings. This is a bit misleading, as constructing a building (and producing all its components) actually requires an &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; amount of energy. But most people have only one house, which lasts at least a few decades and is usually shared with other people. This is why the emissions associated with &lt;strong&gt;construction&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;per person per day&lt;/em&gt; are fairly small: 3 kg for someone in The Netherlands, even though this is still more that the &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; daily greenhouse gas emissions of someone in Malawi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people talk about saving energy or installing solar panels, a lot of attention is given to the direct usage of electricity in buildings. But actually our &lt;strong&gt;home electricity use&lt;/strong&gt; tends to make only fairly small contribution to our total greenhouse gas emissions (for an average Dutchman less than 3 kg per day). Heating actually has a bigger impact. In The Netherlands, buildings predominantly use &lt;strong&gt;natural gas for heating&lt;/strong&gt; rather than electricity, and this provides for an emission of almost 4 kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. per person per day. Taken together, the direct energy use of Dutch households (gas + electricity) generates almost a sixth of Dutch greenhouse gas emissions, or ±6.5 kg per person per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;, especially road and air traffic, contribute around the same order of magnitude as our housing. In The Netherlands, mobility is responsible for 9 kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. per person per day, around a fifth of the total emissions. The figure below shows the source of some of these in more detail for 2010/2012 (click on the figure for more details):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="{static}/pages/ghg-transport-nl.md"&gt;&lt;img alt="greenhouse gas emissions by transport" src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/carbon-footprint-transport-nl.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should note that the contributions of especially air traffic and transport of goods are underestimated here, because only traffic within the country counts in this figure. Nonetheless, you can clearly see that &lt;strong&gt;air travel&lt;/strong&gt; contributes significantly (probably more than 2 kg), but that &lt;strong&gt;cars&lt;/strong&gt; contribute even more to emissions (almost 3.5 kg). Emissions from public transport on the other hand are almost negligible. Commuting and private car-use emit about as much as electricity use at home does. And this is despite the fact that only around half of land-based travel in the Netherlands is by car.&lt;sup id="fnref:nltransport"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nltransport"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Compared to other European countries, a relatively high percentage of Dutch people travel mainly with public transport or on bicycle. The average emission figures actually include a lot of people that either have no car or hardly use their car, so the daily emission &lt;em&gt;per car driver&lt;/em&gt; will certainly be higher than 3.5 kg!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction, direct energy use and mobility together are responsible for just under half of the Dutch greenhouse gas footprint. The other half is due to the remaining two categories. One bears the somewhat mysterious title &amp;ldquo;services &amp;amp; trade&amp;rdquo;, and includes things like infrastructure and the things we do and use outside our homes, in as far they do not fit in the other categories. For most of us, these are mainly the things we do at &lt;strong&gt;work&lt;/strong&gt;, and our use of &lt;strong&gt;public services&lt;/strong&gt; such as hospitals, schools, government services, universities, roads and public lighting. All in all these things cause about a quarter of our greenhouse gas emissions. And unfortunately we have little control over this category, with the possible exception of the things you do at work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the remaining category covers many things we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; control: Roughly a quarter of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emission of European consumers comes from making the stuff we consume. The largest part of this is for &lt;strong&gt;food and drink&lt;/strong&gt;, around 9 kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. per person per day in The Netherlands. More than a third of this is for producing animal protein: things like meat, fish, eggs and milk products. Of course the reason why food contributes so much to our daily emissions is that everyone needs food on a daily basis. Other &lt;strong&gt;consumption goods&lt;/strong&gt; like clothes and electronics often require more energy to produce, but we simply buy such things less often. So it follows that an obvious way to reduce your CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions is by simply buying less stuff, especially buying less &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;rsquo;s not so easy to think in averages, it&amp;rsquo;s good to see how much greenhouse gas is emitted by individual products and activities (click on the figure for more details):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="display: block; margin: 30px 0; width: 80vw; margin-left: 50%; -webkit-transform: translateX(-50%); -moz-transform: translateX(-50%); -ms-transform: translateX(-50%); -o-transform: translateX(-50%); transform: translateX(-50%);"&gt;
&lt;a href="//sustainsubstance.org/pages/ghg-products.html"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/carbon-footprint-products-nl.png" alt="greenhouse gas emissions for consumption goods and activities"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the same caveats apply: these are not exact figures, and estimates for emission will vary between studies, between products and between countries. But again, it&amp;rsquo;s the large-scale patterns that are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of us, this figure will contain a few surprises. The emissions from public transport, taking a shower or using electricity are perhaps surprisingly small. On the other hand, things like paper, cheese and food or flowers grown under glass have an unexpectedly large emission footprint. Most people will not be very surprised by the fact that meat, shrimp and driving a car all have a relatively large carbon-footprint. The contribution of driving however depends very much on the size of the car (and its speed, but that is not shown here). And many people probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t guess that, as a passenger, we emit roughly the same amount per kilometre when we fly as when driving an average car. But because we generally travel much longer distances when we fly, one trip by plane will have a large impact on our emission figures. However, the impact of an intercontinental trip is dwarfed by the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released when making a new car. Buying a car has a huge impact, even if no-one ever drives in it, especially if the car in question is big and luxurious. Finally, because our first two figures use data from 2000/2001, they may somewhat underestimate the current contribution of electronics devices. As an example, producing one computer emits roughly as much CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as 1-3 months&amp;rsquo; worth of food, or driving an average car for 12-40 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Roses in a greenhouse, with additional &amp;quot;assimilation lighting&amp;quot;." src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/storage/rose-greenhouse.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case you were wondering why roses have such a large climate footprint (relative to many other producs), this is a matter of energy and climate. A single-stem rose takes &lt;a href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/42312/2/staff369.pdf"&gt;roughly two months&lt;/a&gt; to grow, and it requires additional lighting and heating in winter, when most roses are bought (think Valentines Day!). Although heat pumps and modern LED-lights can significantly reduce energy use in modern greenhouses, a single greenhouse complex easily requires several megawatts of electrical power just to keep the lights on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to keep climate warming below 2°C, we will basically have to reduce our direct and indirect emissions to zero within a few decades. This is going to be a real challenge for governments and companies. They will have to figure out where to get sufficient, affordable energy to keep their infrastructure, their transportation, their services and their factories running, and to keep growing their food. This is going to take time. But of course we don&amp;rsquo;t have to sit around waiting, there are plenty of ways in which we can help as individuals. Which lessons can we learn from the above figures, how can we start reducing our carbon footprint as individual consumers and employees? The main categories we can influence directly are consumption goods, mobility and our direct energy use at home and at work. There are several things you should consider, if you want to significantly reduce your greenhouse gas emissions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many countries, saving energy at home is a high-profile issue. But energy savings at work often receive a lot less attention. In many offices the heating or climate control is turned on night and day, computers are never switched off, and perfectly functional equipment is replaced every few years, even when this is not strictly needed. As we spend a lot of our time at work, our energy use and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emission at work is often higher than at home. Maybe now is a good time to start discussing this in your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you own or regularly use a car, only use it when really necessary. If you live in a country with decent public transport, consider taking the train or the bus to work. Work from home on a regular basis, if your job allows it. For some odd reason it is generally considered normal that employees come to work by car, even in companies that consider themselves &amp;ldquo;sustainable&amp;rdquo;. Likewise, it is generally considered acceptable that we drive several hours just to visit a client or attend a meeting. Such trips easily amount to several hundred kilometres, and the average car emits 20 kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. per 100 km. In other words, driving for 2-3 hours can easily double your greenhouse gas emissions on a given day. The same trip by a combination of train and bus (or folding bicycle), easily emits a factor 5 less carbon and is very doable in countries such as The Netherlands. This has the added advantage that you can work on the train. Of course, using public transport isn&amp;rsquo;t always a viable option for attending meetings. As an alternative, you may want to research the possibilities of conference calls or video conferencing. Current-day technology makes this almost trivial on any laptop, smart phone or tablet.&lt;sup id="fnref:videoconference"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:videoconference"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For holidays, the distance you travel has a much greater impact than the form of transport you choose. If you do want to travel to far-away places, consider making one longer trip (e.g. a few weeks), rather than several separate short trips. Even better, consider destinations that aren&amp;rsquo;t so far away. And for distances up to a few hundred kilometres, the impact of travelling by train or bus is much less than that of travel by car or plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your climate has cold winters and especially if you live or work in an old building, consider investing in insulation and an upgrade of the heating system. Even small modifications can have a large effect on energy use. In some cases you can already save around a third on heating energy by simply closing cracks and gaps, tweaking your central heating and lowering the thermostat by a few degrees when you&amp;rsquo;re in bed or away from home. Such measures can save you a lot of money, with just a few hours of work and almost no material. But if you&amp;rsquo;re able to invest a bit more, insulating your outer walls and ceiling/roof can have a huge impact on your energy bills. If you&amp;rsquo;re putting up a new building, or are planning a renovation, consider insulation as well as floor- or wall-heating. A large heating surface is more efficient and comfortable than using a radiator, and the lower water temperature will make it easier to install a &lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c21/page_146.shtml"&gt;heat pump&lt;/a&gt; at some point. A heat pump is basically a fridge in reverse: it extracts heat from the ground, water or air outside, and uses this to heat your house or workplace. In theory, a heat pump can be up to 3-4 times more efficient than using natural gas or an electrical radiator for heating&lt;sup id="fnref:heatpump"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:heatpump"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, especially when combined with a thermal solar-collector and a heat-buffer. Moreover, a heat-pump can also function as a cooling-system in summer. &lt;br&gt;
For older buildings where floor-heating and heat pumps are not an option, &lt;a href="http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/03/local-heating.html"&gt;local heating&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/03/radiant-and-conductive-heating-systems.html"&gt;thermal infra-red panels or similar systems&lt;/a&gt; can be an efficient and comfortable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you own your roof, consider placing solar panels. A solar photo-voltaic (PV) installation usually pays back its investment costs within 5-12 years or so (the payback time varies greatly between countries), while it will produce power for 20-30 years. Even better, consider placing a thermal solar collector as well, or a install a hybrid system that can produce both electricity and heat. If you do not have the funds to invest in a PV-installation, you could consider leasing one (through companies such as &lt;a href="https://www.sungevity.com"&gt;Sungevity&lt;/a&gt;). If you do not own your roof, you could consider joining an energy cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t buy things you don&amp;rsquo;t need. This may sound obvious, but check with yourself how many of the things you bought recently (for yourself, your family or for work) were things that you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; needed. If you do need (or would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to have) something, try checking first if you can get it second-hand. And if you do buy something new, you may want to consider product quality and expected life span. Sometimes you end up spending a lot less in the long run if you buy something that is a bit more expensive, but of higher quality. Cheap things tend to be cheap for a reason, and quite often something is cheap because the quality of the materials and the construction isn&amp;rsquo;t very good. Low-quality products won&amp;rsquo;t last very long and need replacing more frequently. This applies to items such as shoes and bags, but also to electronics equipment and mechanical devices such as washing machines and bicycles. If you cannot assess the product quality yourself, try asking someone who can, or check out some reviews. If you buy devices that use energy, their energy efficiency is as important as their life span. More efficient devices tend to be a bit more expensive as well, but may save you a lot of money in the long run. This applies to things such as refrigerators, freezers, heaters, washing machines, dryers, lamps and especially cars. When selecting a car, remember that a small, light vehicle will require significantly less energy (to build and run) than big and heavy vehicles. Moreover, electrical vehicles tend to be more energy-efficient than comparable vehicles with a combustion engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat less meat. You don&amp;rsquo;t immediately have to become a vegetarian or vegan&lt;sup id="fnref:vega"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:vega"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but it certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to eat a meal without meat every once in a while. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to cook a nice vegetarian meal, try looking up some good recipes, or talk to a vegetarian who cooks well. Another option is to simply reduce the portions of meat you use, or replace part of it with alternative products. In fact, most people will hardly notice if you replace half a portion of minced meat or factory-farmed chicken by a decent, vegetable-based product. My own experience with eating less meat is that after a while, you really start to enjoy both cooking a good vegetarian meal and occasionally eating a meal with good-quality meat. It&amp;rsquo;s a win-win situation, although of course your mileage may vary. Just give it a serious try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy fewer products out-of-season. Especially in cold climates, a lot of food is imported, and a lot of energy is wasted on growing vegetables in greenhouses during the winter months. Greenhouses are great at capturing light and providing a controlled environment, but they tend to be very badly insulated and in winter they require artificial heating and lighting. If certain fruits and vegetables can&amp;rsquo;t be grown outside in season, then it may actually be better to buy frozen or canned products, or to look for alternatives. This applies especially to soft fruit and leafy vegetables that do not keep well and are hard to transport.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produce less waste. Instead of throwing something away, try selling it, give it away, eat it&lt;sup id="fnref:foodwaste"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:foodwaste"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, bring it to a second-hand store, recycle it where possible, but don&amp;rsquo;t throw it in the general trash unless you have no good alternative. In most countries, municipal waste is either burned or used as landfill. Both disposal methods tend to produce a lot of greenhouse-gas emissions, while (at least in principle) a modern society should hardly have to produce any rest-waste. Most of what we consider &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo; is actually a mix of high-grade resources, which can be used in producing all kinds of new products. Metals are a well-known example, but also plastics can be seen as a concentrated source of carbohydrates, glass is basically silicon, paper provides cellulose and organic waste contains all kinds of valuable nutrients, not to mention energy. Reusing these &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo;-materials can sometimes save a considerable amount of energy in producing new products. Moreover, everything you give away or sell second-hand, won&amp;rsquo;t have to be bought new by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, do you feel that your work does not make a positive contribution to society? Consider looking for a different job.&lt;sup id="fnref:work"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:work"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The government, the service-sector and the private companies are responsible for much of our emissions, and we want them to start changing the world for the better. But in the end, governments, companies and other institutions are all run by us. There is such a thing as &amp;ldquo;the system&amp;rdquo;, but you should never forget that you&amp;rsquo;re a part of it, and therefore you can help change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:cop21"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A lot has already been said and written about this Paris Agreement, which in 2020 should succeed the venerable 1997 Kyoto protocol.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; has provided excellent coverage of and commentary on the Paris talks and the resulting agreement. Read their &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/15/climate-change-deal-five-reasons-glad-five-reasons-gloomy"&gt;5 reasons to be glad, 5 to be gloomy&lt;/a&gt; for a short summary. While &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/james-hansen-climate-change-paris-talks-fraud"&gt;James Hansen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-governments-fossil-fuels"&gt;George Monbiot&lt;/a&gt; see the Paris agreement as grossly insufficient, others have pointed out that it represents a &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/17/paris-climate-deal-flame-of-hope-diplomacy-christiana-figueres"&gt;flame of hope&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/16/rapid-switch-to-renewable-energy-can-put-paris-climate-goals-within-reach"&gt;its goals can be reached&lt;/a&gt; if governments and the private sector increase energy efficiency] [and scale up renewable energy to 36% by 2030, and that the agreement at least provides a &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-talks-15c-marathon-negotiating-physics"&gt;reason to run harder&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:cop21" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:co2importance"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/co2.html"&gt;In an earlier article&lt;/a&gt; I described why it is important to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The effects of having more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere are hard to predict, and the effects of more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in surface waters are almost certainly negative. It is fairly certain that more heat is being retained by the climate system, but the effect of this will vary by region, and is partially still unknown, which in itself is a problem. It is certain however that this extra heat is &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/science/global-warming-pacific-ocean-el-nino-blob.html"&gt;a big problem for life in the oceans&lt;/a&gt;. And as example of possible nasty surprises, the climate in Europe may actually cool down due to global warming, as the melting ice of Greenland may &lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/3/23/8277345/atlantic-overturning-circulation"&gt;slow down the gulf stream&lt;/a&gt; in the Atlantic Ocean.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:co2importance" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:energy"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If we want to reduce these emissions, we will need two things: alternative energy sources and more efficient use of energy.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
There are alternative sources of energy, but their contribution is currently very small. Globally, solar, wind and geothermal energy contribute around 1% to the &lt;a href="/co2.html#fn:worldenergy"&gt;global human energy supply&lt;/a&gt;. Fossil fuels, by comparison, contribute around 80% globally, and over 90% in countries such as &lt;a href="http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;amp;PA=7516&amp;amp;D1=0-1&amp;amp;D2=0-2,5-6,10,14,22,26&amp;amp;D3=0&amp;amp;D4=l&amp;amp;HDR=T,G2&amp;amp;STB=G1,G3&amp;amp;VW=T"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. The role of renewable energy sources is increasing fast, but a lot of technical and social problems still need to be overcome if solar and wind power are to contribute significantly to the global human energy supply. A realistic expectation is that fossil fuels will continue to play an important role for at least the coming decades, although this role will probably decrease over time. Because we cannot simply cease being dependent on fossil fuels to some extent, it is important to use the available energy more efficiently. Luckily there is enormous scope for improvements in energy-efficiency. Even with existing technologies and methods, the way we heat and cool our buildings, the way we power our transport and the way we produce food can be made much more efficient, provided that we start using better technologies and methods on a large scale.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:energy" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:farts"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An average person exhales roughly a kilogram (2.2 lbs) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per day.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
This is roughly 1.6% of our &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body_weight"&gt;average body weight&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we humans also emit small amounts methane directly, as a result of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence#Production.2C_composition.2C_and_smell"&gt;flatulence&lt;/a&gt;. While methane is a stronger greenhouse gas than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the amount we emit in our daily farts is almost negligible: roughly &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9176210"&gt;6%&lt;/a&gt; of a litre, which comes down to a fraction of a gram per person per day.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:farts" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nltransport"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;only around half of land-based travel in the Netherlands is by car.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Statistics on car ownership and use in The Netherlands in 2010 can be found in the CBS-publication &lt;em&gt;Sociaaleconomische trends, 1e kwartaal 2012&lt;/em&gt;, chapter &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cbs.nl/NR/rdonlyres/69B7DBF3-BA02-4B1F-90D0-40F362C6C4E1/0/2012k1v4p34art.pdf"&gt;Personenautobezit van huishoudens en personen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;amp;PA=37856&amp;amp;D1=0-3,5&amp;amp;D2=0&amp;amp;D3=0&amp;amp;D4=2,5,12-22&amp;amp;HDR=G1&amp;amp;STB=G2,T,G3&amp;amp;VW=T"&gt;StatLine&lt;/a&gt; database shows that in 2007, 84% of Dutch people owned a bicycle, 63% had a drivers&amp;rsquo; license and 45% owned a car.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nltransport" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:videoconference"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;you may want to research the possibilities of conference calls or video conferencing. Current-day technology makes this almost trivial on any laptop, smart phone or tablet.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://hangouts.google.com/"&gt;Google Hangouts&lt;/a&gt; is probably the easiest option for video conferencing, as it&amp;rsquo;s free, it handles video, audio, text-based chat and screen-sharing, works for two or more people, and works on almost any device. The only drawback is that it does require a Google-account. Unsurprisingly, many free services are coupled to social networks: &lt;a href="http://www.peer2.me/"&gt;Peer&lt;/a&gt; uses LinkedIn and &lt;a href="http://www.oovoo.com/"&gt;ooVoo&lt;/a&gt; requires Facebook. &lt;a href="http://www.webex.com/"&gt;Cisco WebEx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.skype.com/en/business/"&gt;Skype for Business&lt;/a&gt; are targeted specifically toward hosting business meetings. Other options for group-meetings are &lt;a href="http://www.fring.com/"&gt;Fring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiMeet"&gt;Jitsi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.viber.com/"&gt;Viber&lt;/a&gt;. For one-to-one meetings, the free version of &lt;a href="http://www.skype.com/"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; works just fine, as does &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/"&gt;Facetime&lt;/a&gt; on Apple-devices, or basically any other video chat service. And for meetings where you don&amp;rsquo;t need video, you can just use Skype, or even a plain old phone, smart or otherwise.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:videoconference" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:heatpump"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A heat pump is basically a fridge in reverse: it extracts heat from the ground, water or air outside, and uses this to heat your house or workplace. In theory, a heat pump can be up to 3-4 times more efficient than using natural gas or an electrical radiator for heating&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Specifically, the theoretical coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump can easily be 3-4 times higher than that of other heating devices. A COP of 1 would mean that all the energy you put into a heating device is actually used for heating living spaces. Modern high-performance gas heaters tend to have a COP above 0.85, which means that less than 15% of the heat escapes up the chimney. Modern heat pumps can have a COP above 3, which means that they can actually pump at least three times as much thermal energy as the electrical energy you put in. In practise however, this does not lead to a factor 3 decrease in energy use or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emission. Part of this is due to the fact that electricity is often generated using gas or coal, with 40-70% efficiency. Furthermore, the efficiency of a heat pump goes down if the outside temperature is low and the heat requirement is high. Still, a heat pump tends to be a good long-term investment, as it makes the heating-system of a building less dependent on gas supply and prices, and it allows a heat buffer to be installed. A heat buffer is basically a large mass of water or rock that can be used to store heat in times of abundance (i.e. summer), and extract it when needed (i.e. winter).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:heatpump" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:vega"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eat less meat. You don&amp;rsquo;t immediately have to become a vegetarian or vegan&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Of course, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, general pollution and soil degradation, biodiversity and animal welfare, being vegetarian or vegan is a lot better than eating meat! But what to eat and not to eat is a choice that everyone must make for him- or herself. In The Netherlands, the percentage of vegetarians and vegans combined is around 4.5%. But the percentage of people that choose to skip eating meat on a regular basis is much higher, around 35% (source: &lt;a href="https://www.natuurenmilieu.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/120606_factsheet_flexitariers1.pdf"&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://edepot.wur.nl/212318"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, LEI 2012).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:vega" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:foodwaste"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produce less waste. Instead of throwing something away, try selling it, give it away, eat it&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
My grandmother, who had to feed several children during the &amp;ldquo;hunger winter&amp;rdquo; of 1944-1945 in Amsterdam, is one of the people who raised me never to throw away food unless it has really gone off. Therefore I am always shocked when I see people, especially friends, dump large quantities of perfectly edible food into the trash after dinner without giving it a second thought. To me, this is a completely unnecessary waste of good ingredients. Try using leftovers in your next meal, make them into soup, put them in the freezer (this works especially well with rice) or eat them as lunch or even breakfast.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:foodwaste" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:work"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last but not least, do you feel that your work does not make a positive contribution to society? Consider looking for a different job.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
One could argue that this measure is actually the one that can make the most difference. But changing your job or even your career will not be easy for most people, which is why I mention it last. This does not mean that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t give it some serious thought.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:work" title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is also available in &lt;a href="http://sustainsubstance.org/nl/co2.html"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;, and as &lt;a href="//sustainsubstance.org/offline/sustainsubstance-20141030-why_co2_should_worry_you.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; or ebook (&lt;a href="//sustainsubstance.org/offline/sustainsubstance-20141030-why_co2_should_worry_you.epub"&gt;EPUB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="//sustainsubstance.org/offline/sustainsubstance-20141030-why_co2_should_worry_you.azw3"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt;) for offline reading.

&lt;p&gt;I had originally planned to write my first article on a different subject, the ecological footprint. But World Climate Action Day and the UN Climate Summit last month persuaded me to write about CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instead. I must admit, I think that maybe too much emphasis has been put on climate change over the last few years. It is but one aspect of an underlying problem, that of energy sources and energy use. Moreover, it distracts from other important problems, such as land use, biodiversity decrease and ethical issues. Sometimes one gets the impression that sustainability is equal to reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions, which is obviously not the case.
Many people are tired of the discussion surrounding climate change. The arguments of climate sceptics and &amp;ldquo;climate deniers&amp;rdquo; have been quite effective in generating doubt among the general public. More than half of people worldwide do not believe climate change to be a serious problem.&lt;sup id="fnref:polls"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:polls"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Yet, despite all this, it is still important to talk about CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Even if you doubt that climate change occurs, there are still good reasons to seriously reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Six degrees and four kilos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s up with carbon dioxide? Relatively speaking, there&amp;rsquo;s only a tiny amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the air, less than one part in a thousand. In the natural situation&lt;sup id="fnref:ppmco2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ppmco2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; this is around 0.03% by volume, or ±300 ppm (&lt;em&gt;parts per million&lt;/em&gt;). The rest of the air consists mostly of nitrogen gas (78%), oxygen (21%) and the noble gas argon (0.9%). So there&amp;rsquo;s really not a lot of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, but still this little bit is actually rather important. For plants and algae, this smidgeon of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the source of nearly all carbon, the main building block of organic molecules. And together with water vapour and a couple of other gases, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is responsible for what we call the &lt;em&gt;greenhouse effect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id="fnref:greenhouse"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:greenhouse"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And this is a good thing. Without this effect, things would be rather chilly on Earth, on average around -18°C. Thankfully this is not the case, average temperatures are a comfortable 14°C. The natural greenhouse effect therefore contributes roughly 33°C to our climate, which is important to keep it habitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, one problem: The magnitude of the greenhouse effect depends on &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; of the various &amp;ldquo;greenhouse gases* we have in our atmosphere. And these amounts are not exactly constant. Before the industrial revolution, the air probably contained around 280 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (on average). But since then, this concentration has been rapidly increasing. Currently it&amp;rsquo;s over 400 ppm, with an annual increase of 2 ppm (and rising). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributes roughly 6°C to the (natural) greenhouse effect, but this contribution is increasing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course our atmosphere is not merely a reservoir that is slowly filled by various gases. Living organisms and other natural processes constantly exchange substances with the atmosphere. Plants and algae need carbon to grow, and as already mentioned, they get this from the air in the form of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, breaking this CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; down into carbon and oxygen requires energy, and plants get this energy from sunlight. Animals do the opposite: they eat plants, and use a small fraction of the carbon from plant molecules as building material. What happens to the rest of the carbon, you may wonder? It is used as an energy source, to stay alive! The carbon reacts with oxygen from the air, which results in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This releases energy, in fact the same energy that plants needed to break the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; apart in the first place. The reaction of (in this case) carbon-based molecules with oxygen is also known as &lt;em&gt;oxidation&lt;/em&gt;, or more commonly, &lt;em&gt;combustion&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;burning&lt;/em&gt;. An average human combusts quite a lot of food every day, and from it produces around 1 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This means that on an average day, the carbon dioxide you exhale roughly has the weight of a pack of sugar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it differently, together we humans exhale around 7 billion kilos of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. That may sound like a lot (and it is), but it&amp;rsquo;s only around 1% of the roughly 575 billion kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that all living beings pump into the atmosphere on a given day. And us living beings have been doing this for quite a while, yet the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentration in the air remains remarkably constant. The reason for this is that plants, algae and oceans also remove roughly 589 billion kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere per day. Natural emission and absorption of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are therefore almost in balance.&lt;sup id="fnref:carbonbalance"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:carbonbalance"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, a significant source of extra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was added quite recently. Below ground are all sorts of fossil remains of plants and animals, buried in the course of millions of years. In some spots, these remains have formed a reservoir of concentrated carbon compounds. We know this as oil, natural gas or coal. From the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century onward, people have begun digging up these remains. Not that we particularly enjoy digging up dead things, but burning these carbon compounds does yield a lot of energy. And we need this energy to power our modern society: Over 80% of the energy produced by humans, is produced from such &lt;em&gt;fossil fuels&lt;/em&gt;. In most western countries this percentage is higher, in my home country of The Netherlands for instance it is 92%.&lt;sup id="fnref:worldenergy"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:worldenergy"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, burning all this dug up carbon does not just yield energy, it also yields CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This relatively recent source emits around 23 billion kg extra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere on a daily basis. This comes down to an average of 3.3 kg per person per day, three times what we breathe out ourselves. And there is no extra sink for this extra source. Worse, the Earth&amp;rsquo;s capacity to remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air has &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt; in recent centuries, in part due to the large scale removal of forests. The result is that the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere has increased, with almost 50% in two centuries. Moreover, this increase is accelerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, this is all not very controversial. The recent increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be measured, and its causes are quite well known. Less clear however, is what effect this extra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will have. One of the consequences is an enhanced greenhouse effect. This is simply because the extra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will cause extra heat to be trapped by the atmosphere. The problem is, we&amp;rsquo;re not sure &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; extra heat, precisely, and we also don&amp;rsquo;t know how this effect will develop in the coming century. There is no doubt that the average temperature is currently rising.&lt;sup id="fnref:temperature"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:temperature"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We can also say with a high certainty that this is, at least in part, due to an enhanced greenhouse effect. But the climate is a complex system with many feedbacks, so what will happen in the long term? Many predictions and projections have been made, but fact is that &lt;em&gt;no-one really knows what will happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id="fnref:uncertainty"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:uncertainty"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Basically, two centuries ago we started the largest experiment in human history. And this experiment is virtually uncontrollable, the outcome is unknown and there is no panic button, should things go wrong.&lt;sup id="fnref:experiment"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:experiment"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Maybe, this should worry us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acid is the new base&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it might just turn out fine. Maybe the extra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will hardly have an effect, and all will be tickety-boo. On the other hand, maybe it will lead to runaway climate warming, rendering large parts of the planet unsuitable for agriculture. We don&amp;rsquo;t know. Personally, I think that&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;pretty big&lt;/em&gt; risk to take.&lt;sup id="fnref:climaterisk"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:climaterisk"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But even if you really don&amp;rsquo;t believe that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributes to climate change, or if you believe that this will not really be a problem, there are other reasons why an increase in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; worry you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the extra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that ends up in the atmosphere, will eventually dissolve in surface water. For the global temperature this is a good thing, as it reduces the warming effect. But if carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it becomes an acid, known as carbonic acid. Dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is what provides the &amp;ldquo;sparkle&amp;rdquo; in carbonated water (and in most soft drinks), and carbonic acid is what gives it a slightly sour taste. Carbonated water has a pH value between 3 and 4. Luckily, surface water contains rather less carbon dioxide than carbonated water does. Most of the surface water consists of oceans, and sea water tends to have an average pH just above 8. Those of you that have paid attention in chemistry class may know that this is not acidic. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite: slightly &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id="fnref:pH"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:pH"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As far as we know, the average pH of sea water has remained fairly constant over the last 24 million years or so, between 8.1 and 8.3.&lt;sup id="fnref:phco2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:phco2"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, over the last decades, the average pH of the ocean water has been declining rapidly, from around 8.2 to just under 8.1.&lt;!---http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rising-acidity-in-the-ocean/---&gt; The oceans are becoming less basic, or to put it another way, they are becoming more acidic. A 0.1 unit decrease in pH may seem minuscule. In fact, in a glass of tap water it would be. But the oceans are not a glass of tap water, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about a well-buffered system with &lt;em&gt;a LOT&lt;/em&gt; of water. In this situation, structural decrease in pH isn&amp;rsquo;t just a tiny natural variation. And for life in the oceans, a small decrease can be a big problem, especially given how fast it&amp;rsquo;s happening. Many of the smaller sea animals have an external skeleton that consists of calcium carbonate. Think sea shells, but also coral, and even some types of plankton. If water becomes more acidic, calcium dissolves more easily, and it becomes harder to build and maintain an exoskeleton. The current, rapid acidification of ocean water can lead (and probably already does lead) to large-scale extinction of corals, plankton and molluscs. And as these creatures are at the base of the ocean food chain, this could endanger the stability of the entire oceanic ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the climate, no-one really knows what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen to the oceans. Even scientists cannot see the future, they can only extrapolate from current knowledge and trends. It could be that the effects of increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels are not so bad as we expected, and we&amp;rsquo;ll wonder what all the fuss was about. In fifty years we&amp;rsquo;ll probably know. On the other hand, the effects could also turn out as bad as we expected, or worse. In that case, we&amp;rsquo;ll probably wonder why the hell we didn&amp;rsquo;t act earlier. In any case, if we just sit around and do nothing, we&amp;rsquo;re taking a pretty big risk. It would be like playing Russian roulette with the stability of both the climate and the ocean ecosystem. And that&amp;rsquo;s, probably, not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;War, crises and resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk management isn&amp;rsquo;t the only reason to curb the human emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The underlying cause of these emissions, burning fossil carbon for energy, is actually a problem in itself. The largest reserves of fossil fuels are controlled by a relatively small number of regimes. And let&amp;rsquo;s just say that not all of these regimes are particularly known for their reliability and good will. Attempts to control and mine fossil fuel reserves have directly or indirectly led to many violent conflicts over the last century, and have caused much human suffering. Control over large fuel reserves gives some countries a lot more influence than might be desirable, and funnels a lot of money into corrupt regimes in Africa and Latin America.&lt;sup id="fnref:fossilcountries"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fossilcountries"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from geopolitical considerations, if you value economic stability and poverty reduction, it is unwise to make the world&amp;rsquo;s energy supply dependent on a small number of centralised energy sources.&lt;sup id="fnref:centralenergy"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:centralenergy"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If the supply is (temporarily) reduced, or is in danger of being reduced, the price of energy tends to sky-rocket worldwide. And with increased energy prices, the price of almost every product and service goes up fast. This is what happened for instance during the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis"&gt;oil crises of 1973&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_energy_crisis"&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt;, and to a lesser extent during the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_world_food_price_crisis"&gt;food crisis of 2007-2008&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, apart from practical considerations, there are also ethical considerations. We could argue that every generation should leave the world as they found it, or preferably in a better state. Currently, this is not what is happening. Granted, socio-economic factors like wealth, technology and health do tend to improve considerably across generations. But playing roulette with the climate system and the oceans, and draining fossil fuels and other natural resources, clearly isn&amp;rsquo;t part of &amp;ldquo;leaving the world in a better state&amp;rdquo;. We still have sufficient fossil fuel reserves to last us at least a few decades. But fossil carbon shouldn&amp;rsquo;t just be considered a fuel, it&amp;rsquo;s a valuable non-renewable resource. One could argue that this resource is too valuable to simply be converted into heat by burning, within a timespan of less than three centuries&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A LOT of energy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of arguments for why we should reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Unfortunately this is easier said than done! If we add all direct and indirect emissions through consumption and services, then the average Dutchman or -women emits between 38 and 46 kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent per day. This is over forty times as much as we exhale ourselves! For other western countries the figures are similar: in the UK it&amp;rsquo;s around 42 kg, in Germany 41 kg, in France 36 kg, and in the US it&amp;rsquo;s a bit higher, around 78 kg.
Of these emissions, around 88% is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the rest is mostly methane and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;sup id="fnref:GWP"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:GWP"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
And the difficulty is, almost everything we do causes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission, because everything we do requires energy. Switching to alternative energy sources is basically the only way to significantly reduce emissions. But this is not so simple, because we currently use &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of energy! An inhabitant of The Netherlands directly and indirectly uses something between 100 and 250 kWh &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;, on average.&lt;sup id="fnref:kWh"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kWh"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Again, for other westerns countries these figures are similar. In many countries, the electricity use is only a small part of the total &lt;em&gt;energy use&lt;/em&gt;. Most of the energy is used to heat houses and offices, to drive vehicles and to produce all the stuff we buy. And that energy is almost entirely derived from fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually our energy use can already be reduced by a fair amount, simply by using the energy we have in a more efficient manner. I will write about this in more detail, in a separate article. But most energy is currently being wasted in transport and in heating. Internal combustion engines &lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/cA/page_254.shtml"&gt;use only around a quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the energy from their fuel for actually moving a vehicle. The other three quarters are discarded into the air as heat, a &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo; product. An &lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c20/page_125.shtml"&gt;electromagnetic engine is much more efficient&lt;/a&gt;, with up to around 90% of input power getting converted into movement. Even if you would generate the electricity using coal (which also isn&amp;rsquo;t very efficient), the &lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c20/page_131.shtml"&gt;indirect emissions of an electrical car&lt;/a&gt; would still be slightly less than the direct emissions from a conventional one. So switching to electrical transport is already a good idea, even though &lt;a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/cost_of_power"&gt;storage of electricity&lt;/a&gt; is still a problem. While batteries these days are much more advanced than those two decades ago, they are still impractical and inefficient. Batteries cost a lot of energy, material and money to produce, they&amp;rsquo;re heavy, charging them is slow, their capacity is rather limited and they generally last only a few years.&lt;sup id="fnref:batteries"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:batteries"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, we badly need more investment in developing alternative energy storage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cold and moderate climates, houses and offices are probably the biggest causes of wasted energy. In many countries, buildings are heated by burning gas. The conversion of natural gas into heat is actually extremely efficient.&lt;sup id="fnref:heatefficiency"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:heatefficiency"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Unfortunately though, most of this heat tends to escape from buildings pretty rapidly. It is radiated by walls and windows, and it is carried away by moving air, that escapes through cracks, holes and ventilation systems. A lot of energy can be saved by simply keeping the heat inside the building a little longer! Think double glazing, insulating walls and ceilings, closing cracks, using heat exchangers, and in general better design of new houses and offices. Technology may help, but significant energy savings can already be obtained with merely low-tech solutions like insulation. Moreover, we don&amp;rsquo;t really need to obtain all our heat from burning gas, or coal, or wood. Nearly everything we do produces heat as by-product. Heat is our main &amp;ldquo;waste-product&amp;rdquo;, heat everywhere in our environment, and heat is relatively easy to store and move around. By better use of heat pumps and storage buffers, we can heat our buildings with a lot less fossil fuels. Currently there is a lot of interest in placing (photovoltaic) solar panels on houses. But if you live in a moderate to cold climate and want to cut down on fossil fuel use, it makes a lot more sense to start with 
&lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c21/page_140.shtml"&gt;placing a solar heater on your roof&lt;/a&gt;, installing a heat buffer below your house and modifying your heating system!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alternatives wanted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By saving energy and increasing efficiency, we can certainly decrease CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by a sizeable fraction. But it will not be sufficient. To drastically reduce emissions we will need to solve the underlying issue of energy sources. This will however require some technological development. Many people believe that solar and wind power can provide all the energy we need, but currently &lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c27/page_203.shtml"&gt;this is not the case&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps they could, one day, but the windmills and solar panels that are currently on the market produce relatively little energy, do cost a lot of energy and resources to produce, take up a lot of space and are relatively expensive. Moreover, our current energy infrastructure is not suited to such intermittent energy sources. We simply have no efficient way of storing lots of energy for later use. Better alternatives for batteries will no doubt appear at some point. Better solar cell technology is being developed, for instance at institutes like &lt;a href="http://www.erbium.nl/"&gt;AMOLF&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam. But it will still take ten to twenty years for such technologies to reach the market. And the problem is, we can&amp;rsquo;t really afford to stand around for twenty years and wait for the technology to get better. If we want to reduce our use of fossil fuels any time soon, we&amp;rsquo;d better start placing as many conventional solar panels and windmills as is practical. They might not yet contribute much to the total energy picture, but they will contribute to an energy transition. The recent increase in demand for solar panels is already driving all kinds of developments in technology and infrastructure. Yet while technological development can be fast, infrastructure will take decades to adapt. We therefore need to invest more in modifying our energy infrastructure, and looking for ways to efficiently store surplus electricity. Especially the latter, energy storage, will be one of the great technological challenges for this generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from renewable energy sources, other technologies are being developed that may contribute to significantly reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions. A &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor"&gt;thorium molten salt reactor&lt;/a&gt; may be able to produce nuclear energy without many of the dangers and drawbacks associated with traditional nuclear reactors. However, this technology will still require a few decades of research and development, before it is ready for large-scale application. This applies even more strongly to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power"&gt;nuclear fusion&lt;/a&gt;, which will probably require another half a century or so of research and development.
Until good, large-scale alternatives are available, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage"&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture and storage&lt;/a&gt; could allow us to continue using fossil energy for a few more decades, without many of the associated greenhouse gas emissions. However, capture and storage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t free. It requires 20-40% of the energy that is produced, and currently it is not financially viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever ways we will use to produce energy in the future, it&amp;rsquo;s important that we start acting now, and it&amp;rsquo;s important that don&amp;rsquo;t put all our eggs in one basket. If we want to decrease CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions within a reasonable time frame, then we should start investing now in research and development of new energy technologies, rather than stalling and protecting existing interests. In this respect, most politicians and policy makers seem to show little vision and daring. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that this will change the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;And what can normal people do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important transitions in societies are seldom to never driven by politicians and policy makers. Important transitions happen because sufficient people want them to happen, because they can happen, or because we don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice. As a citizen and as a voter you influence politics, and you influence others around you. And as consumer, employee, researcher, entrepreneur, policy maker, teacher or whatever role you may fulfil, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait for politics, science or business sectors to start making large-scale changes. In your work and in your private life you can make choices, and in this way influence society. Granted, probably only a small part of society, but a part nonetheless. So make choices. Try to reduce your energy use, and thereby your emissions. Set an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--- But the following figure is ... **TODO: een voorschot?**
[![CO2-uitstoot]({static}/images/co2-voetafdruk-consumptie-nl.png)]({static}/images/co2-footprint-consumption-nl.png) ---&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will end with a rather superficial list of things you can do to reduce your CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions. In one of my next articles I will break down our greenhouse gas emissions from consumption in more detail, to see where the largest gains can be made. But for now, it will suffice to state that by far the largest fraction of our &lt;em&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-footprint&lt;/em&gt; is formed by our buying consumption goods, by road and air traffic and by energy use at home. This footprint can be significantly reduced with a few relatively simple measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t buy things you don&amp;rsquo;t need. This may sound obvious, but take some time to check with yourself how many of the things you buy are &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; required. Collectively we buy enormous amounts of food we don&amp;rsquo;t eat, clothes we hardly wear, trinkets and gadgets that sit unused in a cupboard, cheap devices that are outdated or break within a few months or years, and all kinds of other stuff that we think we need, but in the end &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/graham_hill_less_stuff_more_happiness"&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t really contribute to our happiness&lt;/a&gt;. But all this stuff does cost a lot of energy and other resources to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do really need something, first see if you borrow, rent or lease it, or try to buy it second-hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stop using stuff, don&amp;rsquo;t simply throw it in the garbage. Municipal waste tends to be either burned or sent to landfill. Either way, it ends up as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, methane and/or as other forms of pollution. This is a shame, because many of the products and materials that are thrown away can easily be reused or recycled in some way. If things are still remotely usable, try selling them, giving them away or bring them to a second-hand store. Outdated or broken electronics equipment should be handed in at a recycling point, as it contains precious (and often toxic) materials that can easily be reused. It will cost you a little extra effort and time, but indirectly it can save a lot of energy and other resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that the walls and attic (or roof, or ceiling) of your house, apartment or room are well insulated. Close cracks and holes through which warm air can escape. Consider adapting your warm water installation by fitting a heat pump, a solar heater and heat storage. Also consider installing photovoltaic solar panels, especially if you have a heat pump. If you rent your house, check with the house owner for possibilities regarding insulation and sustainable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t live in a particularly hilly area and road safety allows it, consider using a bicycle for short-distance travels. You can also consider getting an electric bicycle for longer distances, or for hilly roads. When cycling is not an option but public transport is present and bearable, travelling by train or bus is preferable to car or aeroplane. If you know your way around the train systems (especially discount tickets) and book a few weeks in advance, international travel by train &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be cheaper than flying, or can be just as cheap. This is the case in many European countries, e.g. between cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin, London, Brussels and Paris. Over such distances, the amount of time you can save by flying is quite limited anyway, due to the overhead of getting to and from the airport and standing in line.&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, one or two long holidays are preferable to a lot of short trips, especially for intercontinental travel. And if you do travel by car, try to take as many people as you can. Using car-sharing networks such as Blablacar may allow you to reduce both cost and fossil fuel use. And who knows, you may even meet some interesting people along the way&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;!---Direct historical measures of ocean pH (on the scale of millions of years) do not exist.  However, scientists have used proxies (e.g., boron isotopes from ancient plankton shells) to formulate reasonable estimates of historic ocean pH. Pearson and Palmer (2000 Nature) use this technique, and show that global average surface ocean pH has varied over time (though not necessarily cyclically), but that it has been relatively stable over the past 24 million years, ranging from 8.3-8.1.  Most importantly, changes in average surface pH appear to be gradual, on the scale of tens of thousands to millions of years.  What concerns scientists most about the recent observed, and predicted, changes in ocean pH is that it is extremely - unprecedentedly - rapid.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:polls"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More than half of people worldwide do not believe climate change to be a serious problem.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The exact figures will vary between polls and countries, of course. A &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/147203/Fewer-Americans-Europeans-View-Global-Warming-Threat.aspx"&gt;2010 Gallup survey in 111 countries&lt;/a&gt; indicated that on average 42% of adults worldwide considered global warming to be a threat. Countries that scored below 50% included China, Russia and many countries from Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe. However, it also included The Netherlands, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. The US, often considered a nation of climate sceptics, actually scores above 50% when it comes to climate worries. This year&amp;rsquo;s Gallup environmental poll indicates that around &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/168617/global-warming-climate-change-difference.aspx"&gt;56-60% of Americans are worried about climate change&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/168620/one-four-solidly-skeptical-global-warming.aspx"&gt;25% do not believe global warming to be a serious problem&lt;/a&gt;. 
A &lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/citizens/support/docs/report_2014_en.pdf"&gt;study by the European Commission in 2013&lt;/a&gt; found that 69% of Europeans ranks climate-change as a serious problem, 21% ranks it as a moderate problem and 9% ranks it as being relatively unimportant. Interestingly, only 25% of Europeans seem to think they have a personal responsibility in tackling climate change. A &lt;a href="http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/reports-downloads/2011-Reports/nieslen-sustainability-report.pdf"&gt;2011 report by Nielsen&lt;/a&gt; states that 19% of the Dutch respondents were not worried by climate change. Moreover, 33% did not have an opinion, and 48% were worried. This places The Netherlands far below the European average. 
However, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.pbl.nl/sites/default/files/cms/publicaties/klimaatveranderingmensenwerk.pdf"&gt;poll by TNS Nipo in 2007&lt;/a&gt; 90% of the Dutch public does believe that the climate is changing, and 80% believe that humans contribute to this. But 27% of respondents was not really interested in the issue, almost half was tired of the subject and more than half was not really sure what to believe anymore.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:polls" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ppmco2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relatively speaking, there&amp;rsquo;s only a tiny amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the air, less than one part in a thousand. In the natural situation this is around 0.03% by volume, or ±300 ppm.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Obviously, there is no such thing as a &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentration. As far as we know, the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentration has varied a lot over the last several hundreds of millions of years. During recent ice ages it was around 180 ppm, in the tropical climates of the Mesozoic era (the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods) it was around 2000 ppm, and during the Cambrian era it is possible that concentrations were as high as 7000 ppm. However, the world was, quite literally, a different place back then. During the last two interglacials (the periods between ice ages), atmospheric concentrations of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; seem to have been rather consistently between 260 and 300 ppm. Some studies do estimate slightly higher values, above 300 ppm, but this is still significantly lower than the current-day concentration, which is over 400 ppm. Moreover, measurements from ice cores suggest that the concentration has been remarkably stable during the last few millennia, around 280 ppm. Measurements that are based on plant stomata (the openings that plants use to breathe) suggest a somewhat higher variation over the last few centuries, between 260 and 320 ppm, and concentrations up to 400 ppm during previous interglacials. This still seems to be below current-day values, and because human societies mostly developed during the last few millennia, I will consider 300 ppm to be the &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; pre-industrial average, with a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; variation of 20-40 ppm around this level.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ppmco2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:greenhouse"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;hellip; together with water vapour and a couple of other gases, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is responsible for what we call the greenhouse effect.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Actually this name is somewhat misleading, because the mechanism behind the greenhouse effect is different than the mechanism in an actual greenhouse. However, the effect is the same: in both cases heat gets trapped. The Earth receives &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of energy from the Sun on a daily basis, but around half of this is immediately reflected, and the other half is fairly rapidly radiated back into space. Water vapour, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and several other gases absorb a large part of this outgoing radiation, and re-radiate part of it back in the direction the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface.
&lt;a href="http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-quantum-mechanics-explains-global-warming-lieven-scheire"&gt;This video by the TED-Ed project&lt;/a&gt; nicely explains how the greenhouse effect works.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:greenhouse" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:carbonbalance"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Natural emission and absorption of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are therefore almost in balance.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Seen over longer time scales, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the case of course. During the Holocene (the last 4000 centuries or so) the atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; varied between 180 and 300 (possibly 400) ppm. But during the current interglacial, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentration seems to have been fairly stable, which suggests that emission to and absorption from the atmosphere were roughly balanced. More importantly, the historical variations that did occur, seem to have occurred relatively slowly, especially if you compare it to the rate at which the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentration is currently increasing.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:carbonbalance" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:worldenergy"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over 80% of the energy produced by humans, is produced from such &lt;/em&gt;fossil fuels&lt;em&gt;. In most western countries this percentage is higher.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
According to the &lt;a href="http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/key-world-energy-statistics-2013.html"&gt;2013 Key World Energy Statistics&lt;/a&gt; of the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2011 the world used around 13113 Mtoe (&lt;em&gt;million tonnes oil equivalent&lt;/em&gt;) of energy from primary sources. This is roughly 152504 TWh (&lt;em&gt;terawatt-hour&lt;/em&gt;) of energy (1 TWh is a billion kWh, or 3600 terajoules, and 1 Mtoe is 11.63 TWh). This comes down to 21786 kWh per world citizen in 2011, or an average of 60 kWh per person per day. Of this energy, 31.5% comes from oil, 28.8% from coal and peat, and 21.3% from natural gas. All together, 81.6% of the energy we used in 2011 (124443 TWh) was derived from fossil fuels. The rest was mostly derived from biomass and waste material (10%), nuclear fission (5.1%), hydroelectric power (2.3%) and &amp;ldquo;other sources&amp;rdquo; (1%). This last category includes renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, wind power and geothermal energy. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that, at a global scale, sustainable energy sources do not contribute significantly to our energy supply. The main renewable energy sources are firewood and hydropower, and both of these sources are often exploited at the expense of natural ecosystems and small communities. &lt;br&gt;
A part of the energy from fossil fuels is converted into electricity, whereby a sizeable fraction (around 60%) of the energy is lost as heat.
Due to such losses, around 8918 Mtoe (103716 TWh, or 68% of the primary energy) was available to end users, in the form of oil (40.8%), electricity (17.7%), natural gas (15.5%), biomass and waste (12.5%), coal and peat (10.1%) and other sources (3.4%). Oil is mainly (62.3%) used for transport, and gas, biomass, coal and peat are primarily used to produce heat for industry, offices and households. &lt;br&gt;
In total, burning non-renewable energy sources in 2011 caused 31342 Mt (megatonnes) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be emitted, around 92% of total human CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions, and 64% of total human greenhouse gas emissions. Of these emissions, 44% comes from burning coal and peat, 35.3% from oil, 20.2% from natural gas en 0.5% from waste and other sources. &lt;br&gt;
Around 40% of our global energy supply (5239 Mtoe in 2012) is used by the 34 relatively wealthy OECD-contries (the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). These countries represent roughly 18% of the world population (1.26 billion people in 2013). The average energy use per OECD-citizen is therefore more than two times the world average, around 48356 kWh per person in 2012, or 132 kWh per person per day. &lt;br&gt;
In the Netherlands, the gross energy use in 2012 was 951 TWh (according to &lt;a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/energy/data/main_tables"&gt;Eurostat&lt;/a&gt;). Of this, around 92% is derived from fossil fuels: 41.4% from oil, 40.4% from natural gas, 10% from coal, 4.3% from renewable sources (including biomass), 1.2% from nuclear energy and 0.9% from waste.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:worldenergy" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:temperature"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no doubt that the average temperature is currently rising.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Even if you would doubt that such temperature measurements are accurate and representative, there is sufficient evidence for a structural increase in average global surface temperature. The extent of polar ice, glaciers and plant- and animal-populations are good natural indicators of long-term temperature trends. The size of nearly all of the world&amp;rsquo;s glaciers has decreased significantly over the last few decades, and the same applies to land and sea ice at the poles. Many plant and animal species in moderate climates have shifted their range in the direction of the poles, and the tree line has shifted upward in many mountain regions.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:temperature" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:uncertainty"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the climate is a complex system with many feedbacks, so what will happen in the long term? Many predictions and projections have been made, but fact is that no-one really knows what will happen.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
In my opinion, denying uncertainty does not contribute to the climate discussion. Granted, many climate deniers use the existence of uncertainty to generate doubt. The response is often to point to broad scientific consensus. Unfortunately this can be counterproductive, as to some this may suggest absolute certainty. And this is misleading, as there&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as absolute certainty. In a recent interview with de Volkskrant (27 September 2014), logician Johan van Benthem said the following: &amp;ldquo;Many scientists choose that approach: we&amp;rsquo;ll shout them into silence. We&amp;rsquo;ll keep loudly insisting that we&amp;rsquo;re right. And as long as we keep stamping out every spark, reason will prevail. Unfortunately, history has shown that it simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way. Often, scientists will present their knowledge as something fixed, something on which there is consensus. They&amp;rsquo;re basically saying: we thought about the ins and outs with a number of very smart people, and now there&amp;rsquo;s consensus, which you can use to convince others. Personally, I have a different idea about science. I see science as a form of organised discussion, and the power of science is in the quality of that discussion. The fact that we keep differences in opinion open for discussion, that is where we obtain progress. The image that science should emit is one of discussion and debate. I believe that this will make us stronger, because this way you indicate: we&amp;rsquo;re familiar with differences in opinion. And if you open these for discussion, in our way and following our norms, you will gain progress.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br&gt;
It is true that there is broad consensus among scientists regarding &lt;em&gt;the existence of an enhanced greenhouse effect&lt;/em&gt;. However, this consensus does not cover the scale of the problem, or the effects in the long term, and I think that it&amp;rsquo;s important to be open about this.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:uncertainty" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:experiment"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basically, two centuries ago we started the largest experiment in human history. And this experiment is virtually uncontrollable, the outcome is unknown and there is no panic button, should things go wrong.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
A cynic might state that this applies to the development of humanity in general. This does not make it less worrying.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:experiment" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:climaterisk"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe the extra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will hardly have an effect, and all will be tickety-boo. Personally, I think that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big risk to take.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
A nice 15 minute explanation of global warming and why we should be worried, is given in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7ktYbVwr90"&gt;this TEDx talk&lt;/a&gt; by David Roberts.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:climaterisk" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:pH"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sea water tends to have an average pH just above 8. Those of you that have paid attention in chemistry class may know that this is not acidic. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite: slightly basic.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
pH is a measure of acidity. Pure water has a pH-value of 7, which is considered neutral. A pH below 7 is acidic, and higher pH is called basic. Strong acids can be damaging to life, as can strong bases. Think sulfuric acid, and potassium-hydroxide (a strong base, often used as chemical agent to unclog sinks). However, even small variations in pH can already have large effects on biological processes, especially where single celled organisms and small water-organisms are involved.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:pH" title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:phco2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As far as we know, the average pH of sea water has remained fairly constant over the last 24 million years or so, between 8.1 and 8.3.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
This seems odd at first sight, as the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentration has been rather variable over the same period. You might expect that the pH of the oceans would follow the atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but this does not seem to be the case. Probably, the oceans are good at regulating the concentration of dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and buffering the pH of the water, provided that the concentration changes aren&amp;rsquo;t too rapid. Currently however, the rise in oceanic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentration &lt;a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/lsuatoni/why_scientists_agree_ocean_aci.html"&gt;seems to outrun&lt;/a&gt; the ocean&amp;rsquo;s buffering capacity.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:phco2" title="Jump back to footnote 11 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:fossilcountries"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attempts to control and mine fossil fuel reserves have directly or indirectly led to many violent conflicts over the last century, and have caused much human suffering. Control over large fuel reserves gives some countries a lot more influence than might be desirable&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
I do not mean to suggest that you should consider countries such as the US or Russia as &amp;ldquo;evil states&amp;rdquo;. However, Russia does use its oil and gas reserves for geopolitical gain (for which you can&amp;rsquo;t really blame them I guess). And since the &lt;em&gt;Carter doctrine&lt;/em&gt;, it has been the policy of the US to secure their oil supply, using military force if needed. It is unlikely that this doctrine has done the stability of the Middle East much good. Moreover, the US army itself is probably the organisation that uses the most oil world-wide. In 2001 alone, the US army probably used more than 85 million barrels (an estimate from the book &lt;a href="http://books.google.nl/books/about/Crude.html?id=dW9vsUjQc8MC"&gt;Crude: The Story of Oil&lt;/a&gt;). And in 2010 the author &lt;a href="http://www.akpress.org/howbadarebananas.html"&gt;Mike Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt; estimated the emissions from the military operation in Iraq at 250-600 billion tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent. This is roughly what all the inhabitants of The Netherlands emit in two years. &lt;br&gt;
Obviously, mining fossil fuels can have some beneficial effects, mostly in the short term. Until around 1994, the Netherlands built their welfare state on the state income from selling natural gas. In the long term however, this isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a good thing. In fact, the example of the Netherlands is known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_disease"&gt;the Dutch disease&lt;/a&gt;.
Currently, the Dutch treasury receives over 10 billion euros per year from selling gas. But as the gas reserves in the north of the country are shrinking, this source of income is &lt;a href="http://www.dnb.nl/binaries/OS65_tcm46-186972.pdf"&gt;expected to decrease in coming years&lt;/a&gt;. And it is certainly not unthinkable that the reduced state income from fossil reserves will have to be compensated at some point by further spending cuts regarding the welfare society.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:fossilcountries" title="Jump back to footnote 12 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:centralenergy"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;hellip;if you value economic stability and poverty reduction, it is also unwise to make the world&amp;rsquo;s energy supply dependent on a small number of centralised energy sources.&lt;/em&gt;
Note that this applies both to fossil fuels and sustainable energy sources. An important concept that is often promoted for sustainable energy production, is building large-scale solar power plants in the desert. But becoming largely dependent on desert solar power would provide single points of failure, and interruptions in the supply would be disastrous. On the other hand, it is unlikely that we would ever be as dependent on large solar power plants as we currently are on oil&amp;hellip;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:centralenergy" title="Jump back to footnote 13 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:GWP"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of these emissions, around 88% is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the rest is mostly methane and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) as a greenhouse gas has around a 25-fold bigger effect than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. And the greenhouse effect of nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, also known as laughing gas) is almost 300 bigger than that of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In both cases we&amp;rsquo;re talking about estimated potential warming (&lt;em&gt;global warming potential&lt;/em&gt;) over a period of 100 years (GWP&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;). Both gases are present at very low concentrations in the atmosphere (less than 1 ppm), but both do have a significant warming effect. &lt;a href="http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/energy/downloads/methaneuk/chapter02.pdf"&gt;Methane&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively light gas, and therefore ends up relatively high in the atmosphere. Here it stays on average about 10 years, after which it degrades into water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These are both again greenhouse gases, which moreover have a bigger effect at higher altitudes. &lt;a href="http://www.unep.org/pdf/UNEPN2Oreport.pdf"&gt;Nitrous oxide&lt;/a&gt; has a much longer lifespan than other greenhouse gases, it remains in the atmosphere for over a century (on average). Moreover, it isn&amp;rsquo;t just a greenhouse gas, but also contributes to degrading the ozone layer.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:GWP" title="Jump back to footnote 14 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:kWh"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An inhabitant of The Netherlands directly and indirectly uses something between 100 and 250 kWh per day, on average.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The kilowatt-hour (kWh, or technically kW·h) is a unit mostly used to express electricity-use. A kilowatt-hour is the amount of energy consumed in an hour, by a device that uses 1000 Watt. In SI-units this is 3.6 MJ (megajoule). However, following author &lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com"&gt;David MacKay&lt;/a&gt;, I will use kWh as general unit for energy use, because many people are already familiar with it (e.g. from their electricity bill).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:kWh" title="Jump back to footnote 15 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:heatefficiency"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In many countries, buildings are heated by burning gas. The conversion of natural gas into heat is actually extremely efficient.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
In fact, all the energy released in burning gas (or anything else) is eventually turned into heat, so in principle one could say the conversion efficiency is 100%. However, in a gas-powered heating system, not all of the heat is released into the building. Some of it escapes through the exhaust, so the efficiency of most gas-heaters is somewhere from 70% to 95%.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:heatefficiency" title="Jump back to footnote 16 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:batteries"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batteries cost a lot of energy, material and money to produce, they&amp;rsquo;re heavy, charging them is slow, their capacity is rather limited and they generally last only a few years.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
At the moment, the dominant type of electricity storage is the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery. These are the batteries that are used in most phones, laptops and electric vehicles, mainly because they have a high energy-density (energy stored per unit weight or volume of battery). However, the drawback is that after about three years, the performance of most Li-ion batteries tends to start decreasing rapidly. Under optimal temperature- and charge-conditions, some types can be made to last at most 10-15 years or so. Higher temperatures will make a battery &lt;a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/what_causes_lithium_ion_to_age"&gt;degrade faster&lt;/a&gt;, as will fully discharging it. A trick therefore used to extend battery life in electrical cars is to only partially discharge the batteries during normal use. This saves you having to replace the batteries every few years. The drawback is of course that you cannot use the batteries to their full capacity, while you do still have to haul their weight around (which requires energy). Additionally, the Tesla electric sports car and several other electric vehicles utilise a cooling system for their battery packs, which increases life span and &lt;a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/safety_concerns_with_li_ion"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt;, but again also increases weight. To compensate for the weight of the batteries, the Tesla&amp;rsquo;s aluminium frame is designed to minimise weight and drag. &lt;br&gt;
There are many &lt;a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/types_of_lithium_ion"&gt;Li-ion battery variants&lt;/a&gt;. Laptops and phones mostly use lithium cobalt oxide batteries, which have a high capacity but do not last very long. &lt;em&gt;Lithium iron phosphate&lt;/em&gt; (Li-phosphate) batteries have a much &lt;a href="http://eliiypower.co.jp/english/technology/index.html"&gt;longer life span, and are safe&lt;/a&gt;. However, they are less frequently used due to their somewhat lower (initial) capacity. The Tesla model S uses &lt;em&gt;lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide&lt;/em&gt; (NCA) batteries, which have the advantage of high capacity and a relatively long life span, but are also more expensive and prone to overheating. &lt;br&gt;
Apart from the most &lt;a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/secondary_batteries"&gt;common types of batteries&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/lead_based_batteries"&gt;lead acid&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;ldquo;car batteries&amp;rdquo;), Li-ion and NiMH, there are &lt;a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/alternate_battery_systems"&gt;alternate battery technologies&lt;/a&gt; that may hold some promise. The venerable &lt;a href="http://www.nickel-iron-battery.com/"&gt;Nickel-iron battery&lt;/a&gt;, developed by Edison in 1901, is currently seeing a bit of a revival in solar-power storage, due to its low cost and extremely long life span. Modern lead-acid derivatives such as the &lt;a href="http://www.csiro.au/Outcomes/Energy/Storing-renewable-energy/Ultra-Battery.aspx"&gt;CSIRO UltraBattery&lt;/a&gt; also hold promise, although the much-hyped &lt;a href="http://grist.org/business-technology/progress-rarely-glows-blue-eestor-and-the-lure-of-new-technology/"&gt;EEStor ultracapacitor has spectacularly failed to materialise&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/fuel_cell_technology"&gt;Hydrogen fuel-cells&lt;/a&gt;, another big hype (in the 1990s), are also unlikely to be a viable solution for energy storage any time soon.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:batteries" title="Jump back to footnote 17 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
