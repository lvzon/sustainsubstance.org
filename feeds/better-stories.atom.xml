&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Levien van Zon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about sustainability, we often assume that people behave &amp;ldquo;irrationally&amp;rdquo; because they are badly informed. Or perhaps they are selfish, or incapable of thinking about long-term consequences. Some or all of these things may be true for some people, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that this explains very well what&amp;rsquo;s going on. In this article I want to show that the way the human mind works is often misunderstood. Rational thinking isn&amp;rsquo;t our default mode, and better information doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily change the way we think about things. If we&amp;rsquo;re interested in positive change, we should be more aware of what really goes on in our heads, and how this interacts with what other people think and do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/small-tangle.jpg" style="width: 20%; height: auto; border: 0px;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The shape of thinking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you experience your thoughts? This may seem like a silly question. I had always assumed that the experience of thinking would be more or less the same for everyone. Recently I started asking other people about their inner experience, and I was quite surprised to discover that my own is far from universal.
The problem is that I only have direct access to &lt;em&gt;my own&lt;/em&gt; conscious mind. My &amp;ldquo;stream of thought&amp;rdquo; is both auditory and visual: I am aware of an inner voice that constantly talks about my experiences, inferences, plans and feelings. On top of this, I literally &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; memories and abstract concepts as static or moving images and spatial structures.
It is likely that the way you experience your thoughts will be quite different. Yet if I would ask you to look back on your &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;, you would probably do so in a way similar to me and most others: You would experience and describe your life as an evolving &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rationality and its problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans employ more than one mode of thought about the world and our role in it. When we talk about &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo;, we often mean &amp;ldquo;rational thought&amp;rdquo;, a mode of thinking that involves conscious attention. It is guided by reasons, evidence and consistency. Rational thinking is important and powerful, but it does have its limits. In the &lt;a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/entwined.html"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; two articles I argued that the social and natural world we live in is largely &lt;em&gt;complex&lt;/em&gt;. This means that processes can be strongly entwined, making them hard to understand and hard to predict. Such &lt;em&gt;complex systems&lt;/em&gt; cannot be fully controlled using rational planning. Rational thinking is still very useful, but it does have difficulty with complexity. One reason is that conscious thinking requires &lt;em&gt;attention&lt;/em&gt;, which we can only focus on one thing at a time. This is a problem if many different things interact. Conscious thought also depends on working memory, which can hold only a few items. And crucially, for most of its tasks, our mind does not even rely on conscious processing, let alone &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/redthread-mind-1.jpg" style="width: 50%; height: auto; border: 0px;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the modern world &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; strongly rely on rationality. Fields like philosophy, engineering, mathematics, statistics and the sciences have been extremely important in shaping the world that many of us depend on. But these same fields suffer from issues of attractiveness and accessibility. Science and similar pursuits require logical, procedural thinking, which takes effort and often requires a fair amount of prior knowledge. But perhaps more significant is that these fields are far removed from the lived experience of people who &lt;em&gt;aren&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; scientists or philosophers, i.e. most humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are not very interested in abstract or technical subjects. What do we find attractive instead? &lt;em&gt;Stories&lt;/em&gt;, especially stories that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; closely match our lived experience, or that expand it in some meaningful way. Attractive stories tend to be about people and about their &lt;em&gt;goals&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt;. Expository texts like the one you&amp;rsquo;re reading now, which discuss abstract concepts or detailed knowledge, are &lt;em&gt;inherently&lt;/em&gt; much less attractive to most people. You can most likely read and understand this text without too many problems, but you may still have put off reading it. And it may take you some effort to get to the end, while this is much easier when reading a novel or watching a series. The relative unattractiveness of abstract ideas can be a problem, because we &lt;em&gt;do need&lt;/em&gt; abstract thinking and technical knowledge to solve important human problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rational, irrational, unconscious&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of sustainability, you often hear the argument that we all &lt;em&gt;just need to be more rational&lt;/em&gt;, especially about our long term behaviour. There is an implicit assumption that if we just give people better information, they will make better decisions. But contrary to what much of economic theory assumes, humans are not logical, rational computers. And from the perspective of neuroscience, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; forms of thinking involve processes that we could consider &amp;ldquo;irrational&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id="fnref:arational"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:arational"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our thinking is unconscious and biased. All of our thoughts are influenced by our feelings, by social relations and by culture. Even our conscious, &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; thinking is not necessarily based on empirical evidence or on strictly logical argumentation.&lt;sup id="fnref:rational_bias"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rational_bias"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And there are good reasons for all of this. If you really want to make better decisions, or help other people to do so, having good information is certainly useful. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient. It also helps to be aware of how your mind actually works, so you can better use its strengths and guard against its weaknesses. And as we shall see, stories deserve special attention due to their unique role in conscious thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The world in our heads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let me come back to my initial question, how &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; we experience our thoughts? My thoughts are accompanied by visuals and a clear inner voice. Most people seem to have an &amp;ldquo;inner narrator&amp;rdquo;, but it is not always present and can take various forms. Some people literally hear a voice, sometimes their own, sometimes a different voice, sometimes more than one. Other people see written text, and deaf people might see hands performing sign language. In a 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/oct/25/the-last-great-mystery-of-the-mind-meet-the-people-who-have-unusual-or-non-existent-inner-voices"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the Guardian, one lady reported her inner voice was actually a dialogue, involving a radio host asking her questions. Someone else reported that her inner experience included a kitchen, in which a bickering Italian couple argued over her thoughts. Some people rarely think in language at all, instead they experience images, tastes, signs, sounds, colours, feelings or other non-symbolic experiences. Some lack even that, they experience mostly inner silence. However, having no inner voice or visuals doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you have no thoughts. It just means that you aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;conscious&lt;/em&gt; of what your thoughts are.&lt;sup id="fnref:unsymbolised-thought"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:unsymbolised-thought"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In fact &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; thinking is unconscious, for all of us. The thoughts that we consciously experience are only a small tip of the mental iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/redthread-mind-2.jpg" style="width: 50%; height: auto; border: 0px;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form in which we become aware of our thoughts can differ greatly between people. The &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of our thoughts turns out to have a much more common structure. Our conscious thoughts often revolve around our goals and around feelings (those of ourselves and those of others).&lt;sup id="fnref:feelings_emotions"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:feelings_emotions"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Even our &lt;em&gt;unconscious&lt;/em&gt; thought is driven strongly by goals.&lt;sup id="fnref:freewill"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:freewill"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These goals in turn reflect our needs and our values, the things that seem important to us at a given moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fast and slow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the better known models of human thought was formulated by the late psychologist and behavioural economist Daniel Kahneman. In his best-selling book &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he distinguishes two broad mechanisms for thinking. One he calls &lt;em&gt;System 1&lt;/em&gt;, which is fast, efficient and mostly automatic. It depends on unconscious knowledge and skill. This roughly corresponds to what most people would call &lt;em&gt;intuition&lt;/em&gt;. The other mechanism he calls &lt;em&gt;System 2&lt;/em&gt;, and it corresponds to deliberative &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; thought. This mode of thinking is slow, costly and it requires sustained effort and attention. We mostly rely on the fast processing of System 1, and we only invest in the &amp;ldquo;System 2&amp;rdquo; effort of slowly working through information and arguments if we feel we really need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s model is probably a bit oversimplified, but it is useful and it does highlight an important biological reality: We humans may have big brains, but we still have limited mental resources, and these are costly to employ. Where possible, our brain takes shortcuts and simplifies &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo; for efficient processing. Mostly we are not aware of this. We usually regard our internal representation of the outside world to be complete and accurate. But when constructing a model of our environment, our brain ignores information that is deemed irrelevant, and it fills in bits that seem to be missing. Constructing a full and accurate model of our surroundings would be way too costly, so our brain aims for something that is &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id="fnref:shortcuts"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:shortcuts"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is why we don&amp;rsquo;t see our nose, why optical illusions work and why we can easily be fooled by magic tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to simplification, automaticity is also essential. If we would need to consciously decide on everything we do, including which muscles to move in which order and how to navigate through space on two legs, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get very far. We would probably never get out of bed. This is why the coordination of our muscles and our senses mostly happens automatically. Walking on two legs isn&amp;rsquo;t easy, yet we generally manage to learn it (after a somewhat awkward training period in early childhood). Once we have learnt complex coordination skills like walking, cycling, driving a car or playing an instrument, they no longer involve conscious thinking. And in the name of speed and efficiency, many other mental tasks are handled automatically and unconsciously as well. This makes sense, because conscious processing requires attention, and this cannot be applied to many things at once. We &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; our attention at things we are interested in, but attention can also &lt;em&gt;be directed&lt;/em&gt; by mechanisms outside our control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;There is a fish in the percolator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two situations can powerfully grab our attention. One is &lt;em&gt;surprise&lt;/em&gt;, which happens if reality does not seem to match the predictions generated by our brain. This requires that we pay more attention to details and figure out what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;sup id="fnref:bayesian_learning"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bayesian_learning"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For instance, what&amp;rsquo;s this weird section heading doing here? Should I still drink the coffee?&lt;sup id="fnref:fish"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fish"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
The other attention grabber is &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt;, which is a conscious signal emitted by our unconscious mind, often indicating a need for action. The nature of the action required is indicated by the &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of feeling. For example, bodily sensations such as hunger or thirst tell us that we need to eat or drink, which in turn requires us to go search for food or water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have feelings about the &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; environment. These are a bit more complicated (because they are coupled to &lt;em&gt;emotions&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;sup id="fnref:emotions"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:emotions"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but they have the same basic function: They &lt;em&gt;direct our attention to possible needs&lt;/em&gt;, to things that may be important. By pointing out needs, our feelings strongly determine our short-term goals. Fear tells us we are in danger, and we may need to hide or run away. Anger tells us we may need to fight. And positive feelings tell us we&amp;rsquo;re safe and we can rest or play. The way feelings and emotions work seems to be similar across many animal species.&lt;sup id="fnref:animal_feelings"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:animal_feelings"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But social animals such as ourselves seem to possess strong &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; feelings as well.&lt;sup id="fnref:social_feelings"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:social_feelings"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These address our existential need to be part of a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feelings are probably the most direct driver of behaviour in all animals, including humans. They indicate acute needs, but they are fleeting experiences. They wear off once a need is met, or when it is perceived as less acute. Feelings are not permanent and can rapidly be displaced by other feelings. So how then do we determine and pursue long-term goals? This is where stories and our social environment come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Organising experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, a &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; can be thought of as a coherent ordering of selected information in time. 
Most people will associate story with fiction: think novels, movies, theatre, song lyrics, fairy tales and myths. But story is much broader, it also includes biographies, documentaries, personal recollections, conspiracy theories, gossip, advertisements, expressions of ideology, explanations and in general any description of the past or the future.
Stories owe their familiar shapes to recognisable patterns of events that we call &lt;em&gt;plots&lt;/em&gt;. Stories seem to be an inherent form that our mind imposes on our conscious experience.&lt;sup id="fnref:stories_plots"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:stories_plots"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brain constantly works to impose order on the flow of experience. If certain events predictably seem to follow others, we automatically infer cause and effect. When we look back on our experiences, we do not access a faithful recording of everything that happened. Rather, our brain selects certain memories and it ignores others. We tend to prioritise memories that are somehow relevant to our feelings or goals, although this is not something we do consciously. Moreover, the memories that we recall are not separate, unconnected snapshots, they get ordered into familiar patterns. When we listen to music, we do not experience a song as separate, unconnected notes. Similarly, we experience our memories as a kind of coherent story, often with a plot that revolves around our intentions, or those of other people.&lt;sup id="fnref:intention_bias"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:intention_bias"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Our memories are not recordings but mental re-creations, which are edited by our unconscious mind to &lt;em&gt;make sense to us&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remain sane, we humans need our &amp;ldquo;life stories&amp;rdquo; to be coherent and to follow a storyline that feels familiar, in which our lives have a direction. This is where long-term goals are important. In a sense, each of us creates a personal myth by which we orient our lives. This is no static narrative, it is constantly revised as our life progresses. But we do closely guard its coherence. We unconsciously select which information is included into our life story and how it is interpreted. Everyone does this, but the process of selection and interpretation is easier to see in other people than in ourselves. We all know people who seem to spin memories and facts in ways that benefit their own self-image or their optimistic outlook, or less helpfully, that perpetuate depression, addiction or questionable lifestyle choices. And again, they are not usually aware that they do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We contain multitudes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about a &amp;ldquo;life story&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;personal myth&amp;rdquo; may give the impression that we value consistency over everything else. But humans are rarely consistent. Our behaviours, opinions and rationalisations are full of internal conflicts. They can shift all the time. We do not have a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; life story. Actually we maintain many versions, which we employ in different contexts. In other words, we can be slightly different persons, employing a different &amp;ldquo;narrative identity&amp;rdquo; depending on our situation. At work we present a different version of our &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; than when we are among old friends. And the &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; talking to our mother will differ from the &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; that flirts with someone attractive. Our narrative selves can have different goals in different social situations, and we will thus highlight different aspects of our history and our character. We can even have different &lt;em&gt;values&lt;/em&gt;: the things we consider important can change according to who we are with. Unhelpfully, our values in one social context sometimes contradict our values in another context. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t make us hypocrites, it just makes us human.&lt;sup id="fnref:hypocrite"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hypocrite"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
We adapt our behaviour to the people around us because other people matter to us. In fact, it is hard to be a &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; on your own. Your conscious thinking and the elements that make up your life story all depend on the ideas and stories that are available in your environment. And we also use other people to calibrate our moral compass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Messy morals and shared stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morality is complicated, messy and absolutely central to how human social groups are held together. Moral behaviour is guided by cultural customs and by the rules of ethics. Explicit moral rules are encoded in legal systems and religious texts. In practice, morality also depends strongly on intuition and feeling. We have strong feelings about fairness and what constitutes &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id="fnref:affective_evaluation"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:affective_evaluation"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
What we consider &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; is determined mostly by our social environment, by the fundamental values of the people we feel connected to. Such values outline which actions are desirable or unacceptable and what constitutes a rich, meaningful life, as opposed to an empty, meaningless one.&lt;sup id="fnref:social_morality"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:social_morality"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Shared stories are important in this, they communicate shared values, goals and expectations. We can choose to align ourselves with these, or we can oppose them.&lt;sup id="fnref:sharedvalues"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sharedvalues"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
But whichever choice we make, we are not isolated individuals with purely independent goals and feelings. Instead we are more like actors, engaged in various plots in a world of others.&lt;sup id="fnref:actors"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:actors"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/redthread-group-1.jpg" style="width: 75%; height: auto; border: 0px;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared stories are a kind of &amp;ldquo;cultural toolkit&amp;rdquo;, providing us with moral frameworks, explanations and other story elements we can use for our own lives. This also explains why we are so strongly attracted to &lt;em&gt;fiction&lt;/em&gt;. For a story to be valuable, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be true. In fact, fictional stories are often attractive precisely because they &lt;em&gt;aren&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; as messy and unpredictable as real life. Or because they are richer, and thus add nuance and new perspectives to our own experience. Either way, fiction tends to make more sense to us than reality, and we use it to interpret events in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beyond heroes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every sequence of events qualifies as a story. Stories must somehow be relevant to us as humans, and they must have a recognisable structure. Nearly every text on storytelling goes on to explain this using the &lt;em&gt;Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey&lt;/em&gt;. This story structure underlies many myths, popular stories and Hollywood blockbusters.&lt;sup id="fnref:hero_journey"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hero_journey"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is attractive in part because it represents the significant human experience of a &lt;em&gt;rite of passage&lt;/em&gt;, an event or ceremony that marks an important transition in someone&amp;rsquo;s life. We all recognise this as being important. Also, stories that adhere to the Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey structure emphasise group values such as compassion (for &amp;ldquo;good guys&amp;rdquo;) and risking oneself to serve the community. And the &lt;em&gt;struggle&lt;/em&gt; inherent in such stories engages our emotions and highlights a significant human goal: often we need to face fears and overcome obstacles in order to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the popularity of the Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey structure makes it easy to overlook that many stories &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; actually follow it.&lt;sup id="fnref:alt_structures"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:alt_structures"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Also, focusing too much on structure risks overlooking other key aspects of stories, for instance that they are about goals and values, and about making sense of the world. Also, stories have a &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;: they can be more positive or more negative. The importance of such aspects becomes clear when our stories &lt;em&gt;fail&lt;/em&gt; to make sense of the world. For instance, people who express more positive life stories tend to score better on measures of wellbeing.&lt;sup id="fnref:lifestorytone"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:lifestorytone"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They do experience difficulties, but see them as opportunities for growth. Conversely, anyone familiar with depression will recognise that the associated life narratives often have a negative tone. If you are depressed, you experience little control over your life. Long-term goals may be absent or feel irrelevant or unattainable. Much of what therapy does is to help re-frame such negative life stories in a more positive way. More importantly, recovery from depression often involves finding new long-term goals, or new ways to reach existing goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mental versatility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen that stories are central to our conscious experience, our wellbeing, our morality and to our social cohesion. We have also seen that our &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; takes many forms and involves many interacting processes, only some of which are conscious. All of these mental processes are highly functional, meaning that they are &lt;em&gt;very good&lt;/em&gt; at performing &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; tasks. We need automatic processes for efficiency. We require feelings and emotions to point out our needs, to distinguish &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; and to motivate us. We need analytic thought to correct some of the errors and biases introduced by the other, more efficient processes, and to do long-term planning. And we use &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;narrative&amp;rdquo; to structure our experiences, our goals and values, and to share these with others. These are all aspects of &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo;, and they are all important.&lt;sup id="fnref:mental_complexity"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mental_complexity"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But crucially, they all have their weak spots, and it helps to be aware of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The many pitfalls of thinking and feeling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his discussion of &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;slow&amp;rdquo; thinking, Daniel Kahneman emphasised that the unconscious processing of &amp;ldquo;System 1&amp;rdquo; is fast and efficient, but it can also be sloppy. The pioneering work of Kahneman and his colleague &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky"&gt;Amos Tversky&lt;/a&gt; spawned much research into &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias"&gt;cognitive bias&lt;/a&gt;, the many ways in which our thinking tends to deviate from &amp;ldquo;rationality&amp;rdquo;. Biases fall in a number of &lt;a href="https://buster.medium.com/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18"&gt;categories&lt;/a&gt;, which are nicely visualised in this &lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg#/media/File:Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="display: block; margin: 30px 0; width: 80vw; margin-left: 50%; -webkit-transform: translateX(-50%); -moz-transform: translateX(-50%); -ms-transform: translateX(-50%); -o-transform: translateX(-50%); transform: translateX(-50%);"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the notion of cognitive bias is only half a century old, people have long recognised that emotions and &amp;ldquo;gut feelings&amp;rdquo; are important, but can also be highly problematic if left unchecked. This has been pointed out by philosophers, sages and religious thinkers going back at least 2500 years. Notable examples include &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du%E1%B8%A5kha"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism"&gt;Stoicism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism"&gt;Taoism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_ethics"&gt;Aristotelian ethics&lt;/a&gt;, all of which emphasise the importance of emotional awareness and emotional regulation. Contemporary research confirms this. Take for instance the huge 2022 &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.nl/scholar?cluster=18312380402333897238&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0,5&amp;amp;as_vis=1"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of psychotherapy methods by Stephen C. Hayes and collaborators. They found that when it comes to mental health, the single most important skill to develop is &lt;em&gt;psychological flexibility&lt;/em&gt;. As Hayes &lt;a href="https://stevenchayes.com/the-most-important-skill-set-in-mental-health-2/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, this entails being aware of your thoughts and feelings, and accepting them even when they are difficult or painful. It also involves using observed feelings to figure out your core values, and acting in accordance with these.&lt;sup id="fnref:hayes"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hayes"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational thinking can contribute to emotional regulation, and it is essential for correcting biases. However, reason by itself does not guarantee good outcomes. I already mentioned that analytical thought requires attention to details, which makes it difficult to apply to complex systems. But a far more common problem is that rational thinking allows us to come up with reasons for just about anything. Our big brains can easily cook up reasons for why we feel the way we do, and has no problems justifying biased thinking, far-fetched conspiracy theories and all kinds of immoral and even self-damaging opinions and behaviours. 
Also, analytical thinking doesn&amp;rsquo;t magically lead to objectivity, science or progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational thinking didn&amp;rsquo;t suddenly appear during the European Enlightenment. What &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; evolve was the particular &lt;em&gt;social structure&lt;/em&gt; of science. As I discussed in an &lt;a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/entwined.html"&gt;earlier article&lt;/a&gt;, the main social convention that emerged was the &amp;ldquo;iron rule&amp;rdquo;. This &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/thinking/aristotle-didnt-invent-modern-science/"&gt;rule&lt;/a&gt; says that theories are only taken seriously in science if they match empirical observations.&lt;sup id="fnref:ironrule"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ironrule"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As anyone familiar with science knows, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent the appearance of incorrect, incomplete or conflicting theories. However it does sufficiently constrain and coordinate theoretical thinking, so that incorrect explanations tend to be outcompeted or invalidated &lt;em&gt;over the long term&lt;/em&gt;.
In the short run, science is hard work, often messy and not always rewarding. Moreover, this way of thinking, working and communicating is very far removed from the lives and problems of most people. Science doesn&amp;rsquo;t come naturally to us. People generally prefer a good story to &amp;ldquo;scientific facts&amp;rdquo;, with all their nuances and complexities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories work well for us because they combine and structure human feelings, problems, goals and values into a recognisable whole that can be easily copied and modified. This is a powerful ability that humans have, and that we&amp;rsquo;re naturally good at.&lt;sup id="fnref:story_development"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:story_development"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Because stories are packages that contain facts, emotions and values, they can motivate people much more easily than &amp;ldquo;mere&amp;rdquo; factual information can. But the ability of stories to simplify and compress a complex reality into attractive packages is also dangerous. One problem is the risk of oversimplification: simple stories with a recognisable plot and characters (e.g. heroes vs. villains) can be more attractive than the messy complexities and uncertainties of real life. A related concern is that our shared stories can easily be &lt;em&gt;captured&lt;/em&gt; by others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mind pirates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because shared stories are attractive and can influence our goals, they can be used to direct our behaviour. Attempts to do so are easy to find: simply turn on a television or open YouTube or Instagram. Advertisements are basically very short stories that are designed to generate or tap into feelings, in order to influence our short-term goals. Marketing tries to persuade us to buy goods and services. Propaganda basically uses the same tricks to influence the values and behaviour of groups in society. This is no coincidence, as the psychological techniques used in modern marketing were originally adapted from 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century war propaganda.&lt;sup id="fnref:propaganda"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:propaganda"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Propaganda has been around as long as human group conflict, but mass media and the internet have made its distribution a lot easier. You need look no further than contemporary politics, conflicts and culture wars to see that shared stories are potent weapons for manipulating collective thinking and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily we are not mindless automatons, we have various mental, emotional and social defence mechanisms. Marketing and propaganda depend on scale, they can have significant social or economic impact only when large groups of people are involved. But as individuals we are not so easily manipulated into beliefs or behaviours that run counter to our core values. Also, we are used to being bombarded with conflicting stories, and our social environment has a strong influence on which narratives we accept. A healthy, supportive and diverse social environment isn&amp;rsquo;t just important for wellbeing, it can also help protect against problematic narratives. And emotional regulation and awareness are important here as well, because especially propaganda tends to target powerful &amp;ldquo;negative&amp;rdquo; emotions such as fear and rage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the mental &amp;ldquo;weak points&amp;rdquo; we examined can be ameliorated by being more aware of what&amp;rsquo;s going on in our mind. You can train yourself to be more aware of unconscious bias, unhelpful thoughts, corrosive feelings and oversimplified stories. You can also train others. If we want better decisions, it isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to have better information. We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t just aim to &lt;em&gt;educate&lt;/em&gt; ourselves and others. We also need to build essential mental and emotional skills, such as self-awareness and being aware of &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future fictions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tell many stories about what happened in the past, both to ourselves and to others. But a unique aspect of stories is that they can be about the &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt;. Stories about the future are fiction, by definition. But they shape our priorities and our expectations, and we&amp;rsquo;ve seen that they can strongly affect our wellbeing. &lt;em&gt;Shared&lt;/em&gt; narratives about the future have a similar role for societies. They help us identify problems and set shared priorities. Also, if we change shared narratives, we can shift group behaviour and norms in the long run, for better or for worse. Abolishing slavery, giving voting rights to workers and women and recognising human rights were all attained through slowly shifting social norms. Shared stories were important in this. Perhaps less positively, the &amp;ldquo;big stories&amp;rdquo; of religion, socialism and capitalism have had a huge influence on human history, and they still shape how we think about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/beyond-optimists-and-pessimists.html"&gt;first article&lt;/a&gt; I discussed three common types of stories about sustainability. What I called &amp;ldquo;ecopessimist&amp;rdquo; stories have a negative tone, while &amp;ldquo;ecomodernist&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;neo-romantic&amp;rdquo; stories are more optimistic (but emphasise different values). In my next article I will examine two broad classes of stories about the future: the narratives of &lt;em&gt;Progress&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Decline&lt;/em&gt;. We will see that fictional stories about the future have very important consequences for what we as humans do in the present. And what we do in the present does eventually determine the future, just not always in the way our stories predict.&lt;/p&gt;

If you&amp;rsquo;re going to read only one book about neuroscience, psychology and human behaviour, you should probably read this one. With around 700 pages (plus many notes) it isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a short read. But neuroscientist and biologist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky"&gt;Robert Sapolsky&lt;/a&gt; does an excellent job at showing that there are few things as complex as human behaviour. We cannot point to any single factor that determines a given behaviour. Instead all human behaviour is determined by many factors, including our neurophysiology, hormones, all kinds of unconscious influences, our personal history, our age, our social environment, our culture and society, our genes and our evolutionary history. Sapolsky then goes on to show how these diverse factors interact to shape things such as social identities and ingroup/outgroup dynamics, socioeconomic hierarchies, morality, justice, group violence and peaceful coexistence. He ends the book with two general observations (spoiler alert!). First, &lt;em&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s complicated&lt;/em&gt;, but that&amp;rsquo;s no excuse not to try and improve things. Second, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to choose between science and compassion, you can have both. Sapolsky gave a &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_sapolsky_the_biology_of_our_best_and_worst_selves"&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; about some of the ideas discussed in the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Macknik, Susana Martinez-Conde and Sandra Blakeslee. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleightsofmind.com/about-the-book/"&gt;Sleights of Mind&lt;/a&gt;: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals about Our Brains&lt;/em&gt;. Profile Books, 2012.   &lt;br&gt;
Somewhat more accessible (and much shorter) than Sapolsky&amp;rsquo;s tome, this excellent &lt;a href="https://www.sleightsofmind.com/about-the-book/"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; by the research and magician couple &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Macknik"&gt;Stephen Macknik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susana_Martinez-Conde"&gt;Susana Martinez-Conde&lt;/a&gt; approaches neuroscience from the perspective of magicians and their audience. As Susana also explains in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxek4fDqaTI"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt;, your brain doesn&amp;rsquo;t so much observe as construct the world &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo;, and it often gets things wrong. The book discusses the neuroscience behind magic tricks and visual illusions. Many magic tricks take advantage of the limitations of conscious attention and memory, the &amp;ldquo;sloppy&amp;rdquo; shortcuts your brain takes for speed and efficiency, and various adaptive mechanisms that allow us to function in a wide range of environmental conditions (e.g. both by day and by night). Our visual system mostly has pretty terrible resolution, and it relies to a large extent on signal processing, memory and prediction. Therefore we don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;consciously see&lt;/em&gt; many of the things that happen right in front of our eyes. What we see is merely our best guess of what is out there. Also the way in which we reconstruct cause and effect is quite sensitive to manipulation, because we tend to come up with explanations and justifications &amp;ldquo;after the fact&amp;rdquo;. Even if our explanations are wrong, we still consider them to be &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;a fact that can easily be exploited by magicians, mentalists, con men and propagandists.   &lt;br&gt;
Many of the concepts and examples discussed in the book are also discussed by Stephen and Susana in this &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rWvmA-be3X8?si=Ee1VbS-gH4FTkRdf"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; at the 2013 GoldLab symposium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven A. Sloman and Philip Fernbach. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/steven-sloman/the-knowledge-illusion/9781509813087"&gt;The Knowledge Illusion&lt;/a&gt;: Why We Never Think Alone&lt;/em&gt;. Macmillan, 2017.   &lt;br&gt;
Cognitive scientists &lt;a href="https://copsy.brown.edu/people/steven-sloman"&gt;Sloman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.philipfernbach.com/"&gt;Fernbach&lt;/a&gt; point out that we know a lot less than we think. All of us overestimate our individual skill and knowledge, especially outside our particular fields of expertise. We generally deal with complexity by ignoring it. As we grow up, we stop asking questions about the way things really work and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220812-the-illusion-of-knowledge-that-makes-people-overconfident"&gt;assume&lt;/a&gt; that we know quite well. This illusion of knowledge acts as a kind of self-protection mechanism, it supports our self-narratives and allows us to make decisions under grossly incomplete knowledge, while still feeling we are being rational.   &lt;br&gt;
According to Sloman and Fernbach, the purpose of &amp;ldquo;thought&amp;rdquo; is to process information in order to select among appropriate actions. This requires predicting the outcome of actions, and thus understanding cause and effect to some extent. Humans are naturally good at causal reasoning, thinking in terms of causes, effects and influential factors, mostly based on &amp;ldquo;mental simulations&amp;rdquo;. True &amp;ldquo;logical thinking&amp;rdquo; is much more difficult for us, as is diagnostically reasoning backward from effect to cause. Moreover, we think in terms of causal models, not in terms of &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo;, and our causal knowledge is mostly shallow and based on metaphors and stories.    &lt;br&gt;
We use storytelling to share causal information and analyses, because the human mind is much more than the brain of an individual person. Knowledge isn&amp;rsquo;t just stored in the neural networks of our brain, but also in the world, our body and especially in other people. Solving complex problems requires many minds, with complementary skill sets and a division of cognitive labour. True intelligence in the practical sense is not a property of individuals, it is a property of teams. This is often overlooked in individualist cultures, which tend to focus on single &amp;ldquo;heroes&amp;rdquo; as the main causal factor in collective success.   &lt;br&gt;
Due to the collective nature of intelligence, information actually has very little effect on our beliefs, while our community tends to have a big effect. We can easily generate reasons for our beliefs, or copy these from others. Even worse, many of our strong opinions are determined by &amp;ldquo;sacred&amp;rdquo; values, rather than by causal reasoning on how preferred outcomes may be obtained. In other words, strong value-based moral or political positions don’t even require reasons, and they tend to be resistant to the exposure of explanatory ignorance. This helps explain why &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo; matter a lot less than our social environment.   &lt;br&gt;
Certainty and ideological purity are dangerous. The first steps in making better decisions are therefore to allow doubt, to question our beliefs and to learn about our ignorance. For effective problem solving, we need to know what we don&amp;rsquo;t know, so we can go in search of others who can complement our ignorance with their skills and knowledge. Also we should realise that people never make decisions on their own. All decisions are to some extent communal: they are influenced by other people, and they can in turn influence other people.   &lt;br&gt;
Some of the ideas in this book are discussed with the authors in the &lt;em&gt;Leeds Business Insights &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/business/news/leeds-business-insights-podcast"&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; series 1 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ti0DJXMEM"&gt;episode 7&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Here We Are Podcast&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR0M6I_jTjo"&gt;episode 358&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Mark Solms. &lt;em&gt;The Hidden Spring: A Journey to the Source of Consciousness&lt;/em&gt;. Profile Books, 2021. 
&lt;a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/the-hidden-spring"&gt;https://profilebooks.com/work/the-hidden-spring&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
In this very impressive book, the neuroscientist and psychotherapist Mark Solms sets out the theory that consciousness is a much more fundamental brain function than was assumed by 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century neuroscience. Mainstream theory assumed for a long time that consciousness must arise in the relatively &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; cortical areas of the brain, which are significantly enlarged in humans. Solms builds on the work of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaak_Panksepp"&gt;Jaak Panksepp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/antonio-damasio/"&gt;Antonio Damasio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/22911/overview"&gt;Bjorn Merker&lt;/a&gt; and others, to show that consciousness might instead be generated in the upper brain stem, which is much older. Consciousness in their view is fundamentally about feelings, which indicate how well or badly you are doing in life. This is important for survival, because feelings indicate and prioritise needs. Many of our responses are automatic, but in cases where an automatic response does not suffice, conscious feelings are generated as an &amp;ldquo;error signal&amp;rdquo;. This also allows us to respond consciously, which is much more flexible than automatic behaviour, and can incorporate more and richer sources of information. In other words, the function of consciousness is to allow us to &lt;em&gt;act on feelings&lt;/em&gt;. This gives us some degree of agency, it enhances learning and it supports survival in unpredictable contexts. In this view, neither consciousness nor feeling is unique to humans or higher mammals. Consciousness may be a feature of all animals with a sufficiently complex neural network, a position also promoted by Anil Seth in &lt;a href="https://www.anilseth.com/being-you/"&gt;Being You&lt;/a&gt; and Antonio Damasio in &lt;a href="https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/antonio-damasio/feeling-and-knowing/9781472147332/"&gt;Feeling and Knowing&lt;/a&gt; (both of which I can recommend as well). Humans may not be special due to consciousness or feeling, but we do have a number of &amp;ldquo;special features&amp;rdquo;, including symbolic language and social feelings. Language allows us to label, combine and transmit perceptions, categories and even abstract concepts, making them &amp;ldquo;thinkable&amp;rdquo;. This extends our consciousness far beyond the domain of acting on feelings. Verbal labels and stories also extend the concept of learning, beyond the laborious business of acquiring personal experience. Thanks to language, we can build up experience and &amp;ldquo;thinkable objects&amp;rdquo; across individuals, societies and generations.   &lt;br&gt;
Finally, Solms discusses how our internal predictive models may work, following Karl Friston&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle"&gt;free energy principle&lt;/a&gt;. This formal theory basically states that a brain tries to minimise surprise and maximise the evidence for its model of the world. This can be done by either changing the internal model (learning) or by changing the outside environment (acting). Anil Seth also discusses this &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function"&gt;subject&lt;/a&gt; in his book &lt;a href="https://www.anilseth.com/being-you/"&gt;Being You&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;br&gt;
Some of the ideas in &lt;em&gt;The Hidden Spring&lt;/em&gt; are discussed by Solms in the &lt;em&gt;Machine Learning Street Talk&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meUtWtY00H8"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; and in a Royal Institution &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmuYrnOVmfk"&gt;science video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.ethankross.com/"&gt;Ethan Kross&lt;/a&gt; is a researcher who specialises on emotional regulation. He discusses the function and importance of emotions, as well as the many problems that can result from strong emotions or our attempts to suppress them. He then gives a number of strategies to manage emotion in healthy ways.

These three book chapters offer a decent introduction to the field of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_psychology"&gt;&lt;em&gt;narrative psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which arose in the 1970s and 1980s based on the work of scholars such as &lt;a href="https://web.lemoyne.edu/hevern/narpsych/nr-theorists/sarbin_theodore_r.html"&gt;Theodore R. Sarbin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bruner#Narrative_construction_of_reality"&gt;Jerome Bruner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ric%C5%93ur"&gt;Paul Ricœur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_P._McAdams"&gt;Dan P. McAdams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_(philosopher)"&gt;Charles Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Carr_(phenomenology_scholar)"&gt;David Carr&lt;/a&gt; and others. Sarbin &lt;a href="https://books.google.nl/books/about/Narrative_Psychology.html?id=cVDDEAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;amp;redir_esc=y"&gt;contrasted&lt;/a&gt; the machine metaphor that, he argued, underlay much of mainstream psychology with that of the narrative metaphor. In giving accounts of ourselves or of others, we are guided by narrative plots, and we render events into a story. Ricoeur &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvpj7gg4"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; (in his 1984 book &lt;em&gt;Time and Narrative&lt;/em&gt;) that we need to create narratives to bring order and meaning to a constantly changing world. Carr &lt;a href="https://iupress.org/9780253206039/time-narrative-and-history/"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that human experience inherently has a narrative or story-telling character. McAdams &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11541946946448646706&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0,5"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that we seek to provide our scattered and often confusing experiences with a sense of coherence by arranging the episodes of our lives into stories, which are in essence &amp;ldquo;personal myths&amp;rdquo;. And Bruner &lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674003613"&gt;distinguished&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;narrative modes of knowing&amp;rdquo; (in which the lived experience is central) from &amp;ldquo;paradigmatic knowing&amp;rdquo; (which is about relationships among measurable variables).&lt;/p&gt;

Consultant and (former) professional poker player Annie Duke shows that biases and self narratives are almost guaranteed to distort our attempts at making “rational” decisions. Decision making involves predicting the future to some extent, which is always subjective and requires both imagination and an accurate feeling for probabilities and uncertainties. Higher quality decisions can be obtained when we reduce bias and maximise learning based on all the useful information we can get. Imagination and &amp;ldquo;mental time travel&amp;rdquo; are important in anticipating possible obstacles, while &amp;ldquo;positive thinking&amp;rdquo; can cause problems because it hides potential problems while boosting confidence. Actively searching for dissenting opinions and &amp;ldquo;outside views&amp;rdquo; is essential to reduce groupthink, rationalisation and overconfidence. Duke discusses many useful techniques, and she shows how hard it is to engage in truly rational thinking. The role of chance is much bigger than we think, the effect of our decisions tends to be limited and there is much more we don&amp;rsquo;t know than what we do know. We &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; and should make higher quality decisions, but it is hard work that requires a lot of self-discipline. Academic readers may notice that many of the techniques described by Duke are functionally quite similar to Bayesian approximation and are operationalised in one way or another in the scientific method and the social structures of academia, as described by philosopher &lt;a href="https://www.strevens.org/scientia"&gt;Michael Strevens&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;br&gt;
Duke also discusses her ideas on &lt;a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/making-better-decisions-annie-duke"&gt;Lenny&amp;rsquo;s Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, in the Modern Wisdom Podcast &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKMz9CEsueU"&gt;episode 233&lt;/a&gt; and in the Rational Reminder Podcast &lt;a href="https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/120"&gt;episode 120&lt;/a&gt;. The book&amp;rsquo;s main points are summarised in this short Lozeron Academy &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUB8l1Fz0mA"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In this bestseller, Daniel Kahneman introduced the subject of cognitive bias to a broader public.

These accessible books further discuss several interesting aspects of neuroscience. Neurologist &lt;a href="https://www.rburton.com"&gt;Robert Burton&lt;/a&gt; argues that certainty is a feeling, rather than something that is based on careful deliberation and facts. This &amp;ldquo;feeling of knowing&amp;rdquo; is independent of actual knowledge or the products of reason, and it forms the basis of mystical revelations, religious experience and many forms of overconfidence. You can also listen to an &lt;a href="https://www.econtalk.org/robert-burton-on-being-certain/"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the author on EconTalk.   &lt;br&gt;
In &lt;em&gt;The Self Illusion&lt;/em&gt; (and in this online &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9IyiQFjxP4"&gt;lecture&lt;/a&gt;), psychologist &lt;a href="https://brucemhood.wordpress.com/about/"&gt;Bruce Hood&lt;/a&gt; argues that reality as we perceive it is not something that objectively exists, but something that our brains construct from moment to moment. Moreover, what we experience as the &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; is also a mental illusion. Our experience of being a &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; emerges across childhood, as the brain constructs story-models from our experience, which strongly interact with the influences of other people. The feeling of being a &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; is important, however, because it provides us with a focal point to hang experiences together, both in the present and integrated over our lifetime.    &lt;br&gt;
Finally, social psychologist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bargh"&gt;John Bargh&lt;/a&gt; offers an overview of the many unconscious and automatic aspects of cognition, many of which are highly functional. He also discusses some of the ways in which our environment ends up influencing our thoughts, feelings and decisions. Many subjects from the book are also discussed by Bargh in this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t6hFJGmlRo"&gt;lecture&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

These four books offer a nice introduction to many aspects of stories, including some of the underlying psychology and neuroscience, important story elements, the social functions of story and the negative side-effects of simplified stories, especially in the context of social identities and between-group violence. These books are very readable, but the downside is that much of this writing does tend to overstate the impact of story. Yes, story is important because it structures our experience, integrates with our emotions and it can be transferred to other people. But it&amp;rsquo;s good to keep in mind that many other factors also influence our wellbeing and our behaviour, as Robert Sapolsky nicely shows in his book &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/311787/behave-by-robert-m-sapolsky"&gt;Behave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In the first of these three academic books, Paul Armstrong contemplates the neural basis of narratives, with a focus on fictional stories (e.g. literature and film). He discusses how our brain links perceived effects to their perceived causes, and how we use this to transform our experience into familiar narrative patterns. The narratives we construct and recognise are strongly influenced by culture, but our narratives can also end up influencing culture. Collectively, we construct and use narratives to make sense of the world. Unfortunately, some of Armstrong&amp;rsquo;s conclusions seem rather speculative, and his writing can be a bit abstruse.   &lt;br&gt;
The other two books offer an in-depth exploration of the applications of narrative techniques in psychology, including life interviews and the use of narrative methods in therapy. &lt;/p&gt;

The short introduction to emotion discusses, among other things, the evolution and function of emotions and their biological basis, the science of happiness, and the role that emotions play in memory and decision-making.   &lt;br&gt;
Simon Blackburn&amp;rsquo;s short introduction to ethics nicely illustrates how we collectively construct stories about which things are &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; and which things are &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo;. Blackburn points out that such stories are important in guiding our sense of morality, but that we need to be aware of their limitations and assumptions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:arational"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;from the perspective of neuroscience, all forms of thinking involve processes that we could consider &amp;ldquo;irrational&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Technically, we should probably call some of these processes &lt;em&gt;arational&lt;/em&gt; rather than irrational. An arational process has nothing to do with rational thinking. An irrational one does, but it does not fulfill the standards of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality"&gt;rationality&lt;/a&gt;. Processes involved in, say, motor function have relatively little to do with rational thinking (although we do engage motor circuits in mental simulation). But mental processes that lead to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias"&gt;cognitive bias&lt;/a&gt; can clearly cause irrational outcomes. Such &amp;ldquo;irrational&amp;rdquo; processes are also responsible for intuition and &amp;ldquo;gut feeling&amp;rdquo;. Interestingly, these forms of mental (and bodily) processing can sometimes yield &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; outcomes than rational processing would do. This applies mostly to rapid decisions or dealing with high complexity (which includes many social situations). Our irrational (or arational) intuition is relatively well-equipped to handle such situations, although good outcomes are certainly not guaranteed, and experience matters a lot in such cases.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:arational" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:rational_bias"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even our conscious, &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; thinking is not necessarily based on empirical evidence or on strictly logical argumentation.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Science and philosophy are hard, precisely because strict logical thinking doesn&amp;rsquo;t come naturally to us, and finding and verifying proper empirical support is very time-consuming (if we find it at all). Much of our day-to-day &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; thinking actually isn&amp;rsquo;t logical &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning"&gt;deduction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"&gt;induction&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning"&gt;abduction&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it is based on mental simulations of how causes lead to effects. This type of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/ee7y4opg/release/1"&gt;causal reasoning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; based on internal simulation seems to be something we are good at, and it may well form the basis of imagination and storytelling. Unfortunately these same faculties also allow us to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(psychology)"&gt;rationalise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation"&gt;confabulate&lt;/a&gt;. We can easily come up with &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; explanations that have little to do with logical reasoning and are not well-supported by empirical evidence. Or we selectively look for evidence supporting our existing beliefs, while ignoring counter-evidence. This behaviour, known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;, is almost impossible to avoid, which is why science requires peer review and strict adherence to empirical observation in order to function well.    &lt;br&gt;
However, often we feel we are certain of things, even &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; engaging in much rational thinking or having any empirical support. Cognitive scientists Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach describe many examples of this in their book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/steven-sloman/the-knowledge-illusion/9781509813087"&gt;The Knowledge Illusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (and in a &lt;a href="https://www.tedxmilehigh.com/unmasking-ignorance/"&gt;TEDx talk&lt;/a&gt; on the same subject). A well-known example of this is the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"&gt;Dunning-Kruger&lt;/a&gt; effect&lt;/em&gt;: if you know little about a given subject, you will tend to overestimate your competence in that field. And in his book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rburton.com/_i_on_being_certain_i___believing_you_are_right_even_when_you_re_not_63166.htm"&gt;On Being Certain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, neurologist Robert Burton argues that certainty is a feeling, rather than something that is based on careful deliberation or facts. He calls this &amp;ldquo;the feeling of knowing&amp;rdquo;. It is the feeling we get upon sudden insight, and the driving force that keeps us looking for evidence to support things we &amp;ldquo;know to be true&amp;rdquo;. It also forms the basis of mystical revelations, religious experience and many forms of overconfidence.   &lt;br&gt;
Rationalisation and the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220812-the-illusion-of-knowledge-that-makes-people-overconfident"&gt;illusion of knowledge&lt;/a&gt; may seem like &amp;ldquo;bugs&amp;rdquo; in our mental system, from the perspective of rationality. But these mental features are actually quite functional in daily life, acting as a kind of self-protection mechanism in a complex and unpredictable environment. The various forms of self-confidence allow us to make decisions under grossly incomplete knowledge, while still &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; we are being rational.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:rational_bias" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:unsymbolised-thought"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, having no inner voice or visuals doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you have no thoughts. It just means that you aren&amp;rsquo;t conscious of what your thoughts are.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
This is called &lt;em&gt;unsymbolised thinking&lt;/em&gt;. In a 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/how-should-we-think-about-our-different-styles-of-thinking"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the New Yorker, Joshua Rothman describes what this is like. He has fully formed thoughts, but they appear in his consciousness only when he is talking or writing.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:unsymbolised-thought" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:feelings_emotions"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our conscious thoughts often revolve around our goals and around feelings&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
I use &amp;ldquo;feeling&amp;rdquo; in the neurological sense of the word: as &lt;em&gt;something we consciously feel&lt;/em&gt;, or more &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling"&gt;formally&lt;/a&gt; as &amp;ldquo;a self-contained phenomenal experience&amp;rdquo;. Feelings can be generated by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"&gt;sensations&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needs"&gt;needs&lt;/a&gt; or by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt; (and in fact, all three are closely connected and can overlap to some extent). Sensations can be internal to our body (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoception"&gt;interoceptive&lt;/a&gt;) or about external things (exteroceptive). An emotion is at least in part a bodily response to a situation, a memory or an anticipation. These bodily responses (e.g. an increased heart rate and other effects of stress hormones) lead to internal sensations, which we then become aware of as feelings. It is therefore not surprising that we tend to associate feelings with emotions, and that we associate the heart with strong emotion. Many emotions trigger changes in heart rate and circulatory patterns, and we consciously experience such effects as &amp;ldquo;feelings&amp;rdquo;.      &lt;br&gt;
Feelings and emotions are not the same, although they are often used interchangeably in common speech. Emotion does lead to feeling, but feeling is a more general term. Pain and hunger are feelings, but they are not emotions. For a more detailed discussion, check out the work of &lt;a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/antonio-damasio/"&gt;Antonio Damasio&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. as summarised in his short book &lt;a href="https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/antonio-damasio/feeling-and-knowing/9781472147332/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feeling and Knowing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:feelings_emotions" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref2:feelings_emotions" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:freewill"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even our unconscious thought is driven strongly by goals.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
The fact that many of our decisions are unconscious and automatic is often used to argue against the existence of free will. In his excellent book &lt;a href="https://www.kjmitchell.com/books"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free Agents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, neurobiologist and genetics researcher &lt;a href="https://www.kjmitchell.com"&gt;Kevin J. Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; argues that this is due to an overly narrow (and human-centric) definition of &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo;. Organisms, ranging from microbes to roundworms to humans, all have goals that are related to survival and that drive flexible behaviour in unpredictable environments. In order to allow for flexible responses, organisms build internal predictive models of their world, which are embodied in neural and molecular networks and other physiological structures. These models allow living beings to &lt;em&gt;do things&lt;/em&gt;, to act as agents that can cause things to happen, driven by their internal predictions and goals. Even if much of our mental processing isn&amp;rsquo;t conscious, we are still causal agents in this sense, and we act according to internal goals. These goals can be set or shifted consciously at least to some extent, so they offer a way to influence our unconscious and automatic mental processes.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:freewill" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:shortcuts"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constructing a full and accurate model of our surroundings would be way too costly, so our brain aims for something that is &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
For instance, rather than recognise, track and learn about every individual object or person around us, we put things and people into broad categories about which we may hold general assumptions. And our sensory system is mostly sensitive to change, it ignores signals that are always present (e.g. we don&amp;rsquo;t see our nose, even though it is in our visual field). In general, our brain suppresses the processing of data that it deems predictable and thus uninformative. When we feel our situation is sufficiently familiar, we unconsciously draw many of our &amp;ldquo;perceptions&amp;rdquo; from memory. This generates a &amp;ldquo;prediction of the present&amp;rdquo; that is largely incomplete and full of assumptions, but usually works well enough for us. However, magicians exploit the fact that we actually perceive only very little of our surroundings. This is explained very nicely by Stephen Macknik, Susana Martinez-Conde and Sandra Blakeslee in their book &lt;a href="https://www.sleightsofmind.com/about-the-book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleights of Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;br&gt;
The fast processing of &lt;em&gt;System 1&lt;/em&gt; that Daniel Kahneman describes in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another example of the widespread use of mental shortcuts by our brain and our body.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:shortcuts" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:bayesian_learning"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two situations can powerfully grab our attention. One is surprise, which happens if reality does not seem to match the predictions generated by our brain. This requires that we pay more attention to details and figure out what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
So-called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function"&gt;Bayesian brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; theories postulate that the brain tries to minimise prediction error. One of the strongest proponents of this approach is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/11/5/nwae025/7571549"&gt;Karl Friston&lt;/a&gt;, and readable descriptions of the underlying ideas are given by 
Anil Seth in his book &lt;a href="https://www.anilseth.com/being-you/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and by Mark Solms in &lt;a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/the-hidden-spring"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hidden Spring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Karl Friston&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle"&gt;formal approach&lt;/a&gt; basically states that a brain tries to minimise surprise and maximise the evidence for its model of the world. An organism can do this by either changing its internal model (i.e. by paying attention and learning) or by changing the outside environment (i.e. by acting on the world). Friston talks about this on the Big Biology Podcast &lt;a href="https://www.bigbiology.org/episodes/2021/9/30/ep-70-the-virus-and-the-vegan-how-the-brain-gains-inference-with-karl-friston"&gt;episode 70&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:bayesian_learning" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:fish"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a fish in the percolator [&amp;hellip;] Should I still drink the coffee?&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Also, what does David Lynch have to do with any of this?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:fish" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:emotions"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We also have feelings about the external environment. These are a bit more complicated (because they are linked to emotions)&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
As pointed out in an earlier footnote&lt;sup id="fnref2:feelings_emotions"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:feelings_emotions"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, 
feelings and emotions are different things. Emotions are (at least in part) coordinated physiological responses to things happening in our environment (or to past events that we recall from memory, or to future situations that we anticipate). Feelings are the aspects of emotional responses that we consciously &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;. Emotions are thus feelings and responses in one single package, and they can go far beyond the kind of &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; bodily responses that occur in, say, rage or lust. Complex emotions may co-opt some of the neural circuitry of more &amp;ldquo;primitive&amp;rdquo; ones (e.g. those for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn3231"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;). But complex emotions are hybrid processes that can involve various interacting emotional circuits, learnt behaviour, our reward system and various kinds of &amp;ldquo;higher-level&amp;rdquo; mental processing. Some examples of this are discussed by Mark Solms in chapter 5 of his book &lt;a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/the-hidden-spring"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hidden Spring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and by Robert Sapolsky in chapter 7 of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/311787/behave-by-robert-m-sapolsky"&gt;Behave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.    &lt;br&gt;
Emotions are about our needs relative to the external environment, which in a social species like humans largely consists of other humans. Because our environment isn&amp;rsquo;t static, the regulation of emotions requires some degree of learning about things in our direct environment, especially the behaviour of other people close to us. This learning involves our &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system"&gt;reward system&lt;/a&gt;, which predicts rewards as well as (to some extent) &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.92938.3"&gt;punishments&lt;/a&gt;. These systems can automatically regulate emotions and behaviours up or down, depending on our learnt predictions. This is necessary, because we need to learn when we can or should engage emotional responses such as fear, rage or lust, and when to suppress them. Unregulated emotions are very problematic for social species such as ourselves. However, quite a few things can go wrong in this learning process. For instance, fear conditioning is very &lt;a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/single-event-learning"&gt;rapid&lt;/a&gt; and can happen early in life, before we lay down conscious memories. We can thus be afraid of things without knowing why, due to something that happened in our early childhood. Also, problems with attachment to caregivers (e.g. separation anxiety) or other forms of chronic stress early in life can have long-lasting and significant effects later in life. Bad outcomes may include anxiety, depression and other &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3867253/"&gt;mood disorders&lt;/a&gt;, as well as unhealthy attachment and addiction.   &lt;br&gt;
Emotions may be largely automatic (we have little conscious control over them), but they strongly influence our conscious, voluntary behaviour, especially under conditions of uncertainty. They are highly functional for survival and social coordination, as long as their regulation does not go awry. Despite the fact that emotional responses are mostly automatic, we can learn to regulate them in healthy ways, and we can correct unhealthy regulation later in life. Examples of how we can do this are given by Ethan Kross in his book &lt;a href="https://www.ethankross.com/books/shift"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:emotions" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:animal_feelings"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The way feelings and emotions work seems to be similar across many animal species.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
The basic way in which feelings work at the neurological and hormonal level seems to be similar for all mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and other animals with a backbone (vertebrates). At least all mammals also seem to share a set of basic emotional states, which relate to things happening in the immediate external environment, and which include fear, rage, lust, play, care and panic/grief. This list of seven basic emotions in mammals (and certain birds) was proposed by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaak_Panksepp"&gt;Jaak Panksepp&lt;/a&gt;, based on animal experiments. They are described in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2004.10.004"&gt;Panksepp&lt;/a&gt; (2005, &lt;a href="https://journalpsyche.org/articles/0xc02e.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) and in his book &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=qqcRGagyEuAC&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PR13&amp;amp;ots=-QJ4Z-ClpD&amp;amp;sig=DPdIoKP4JHqWlqSJMgYhIra6tIY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Affective Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1998). Different emotional &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion#Basic_emotions_theory"&gt;classification&lt;/a&gt; schemes have been proposed by other authors, mostly based on human studies. Note that the various theories on how emotions work are generally not mutually exclusive, they mostly differ in the relative importance they assign to various processes.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:animal_feelings" title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:social_feelings"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;social animals such as ourselves seem to possess strong social feelings as well.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Our social feelings are the conscious experiences of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_emotions"&gt;social emotions&lt;/a&gt; such as embarrassment, guilt, shame, jealousy and pride. These are complex emotions, which are coupled to our ability to imagine other people&amp;rsquo;s mental states. However, many social emotions seem to involve the activation of much older neural circuits, such as those for &lt;em&gt;pain&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, the pain we feel at social rejection actually &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn3231"&gt;activates&lt;/a&gt; many of the same brain circuits as physical pain does.   &lt;br&gt;
Interestingly, the relatively individualistic Western cultures typically don&amp;rsquo;t have dedicated words for some social emotions that are recognised in more collectivist cultures. An example is &lt;a href="https://interculturalwordsensei.org/%E7%94%98%E3%81%88-amae/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;amae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (甘え), which plays an important role in Japanese society and translates loosely as &amp;ldquo;dependence&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;indulgent reliance&amp;rdquo;. People from other cultures may certainly recognise the associated feelings, but recognition of such an emotion (as a single unit) seems to be culturally determined.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:social_feelings" title="Jump back to footnote 11 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:stories_plots"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In essence, a story can be thought of as a coherent ordering of selected information in time. [&amp;hellip;] Stories owe their familiar shapes to recognisable patterns of events that we call plots.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
See e.g. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.12.016"&gt;Mar&lt;/a&gt; (2004) and &lt;a href="https://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/5127/2/Chapter_1_Michelle_Crossley.pdf"&gt;Crossley&lt;/a&gt; (2002). Unfortunately there is no commonly agreed-upon definition of terms such as &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;narrative&lt;/em&gt;. In colloquial usage, story and narrative are more or less the same thing, but various authors, fields and dictionaries define them in different ways. Unfortunately many of these definitions are incompatible with each other and sometimes even with common human experience, as the author Kendal Haven &lt;a href="https://www.google.nl/books/edition/Story_Proof/FOfEEAAAQBAJ?hl=nl&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;pg=PA11&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; in his book &lt;em&gt;Story Proof&lt;/em&gt;.    &lt;br&gt;
I will treat &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;narrative&amp;rdquo; as more or less equivalent, and I will mostly use these terms in a sense suggested by the philosopher &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ric%C5%93ur"&gt;Paul Ricoeur&lt;/a&gt;. For Ricoeur, narrative refers to how humans experience time, the ways in which we understand future potentialities and mentally organise our sense of the past (see &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/post-clinical/201604/paul-ricoeur-and-narrative-identity"&gt;Rhodes&lt;/a&gt;, 2016). Narrative in this sense is a fundamental mental construct, a way of organising time and experience and relating it to meaning. According to Ricoeur, humans &amp;ldquo;narrativise&amp;rdquo; their past, and we carry out &amp;ldquo;emplotment&amp;rdquo;: we draw together disparate past events into a meaningful whole, by establishing causal and meaningful connections between them. In this way, the past is connected to the present, to our values and to future goals and possibilities. Familiar patterns are established (in the form of plots), and the future, in turn, is seen as a set of potential narratives.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:stories_plots" title="Jump back to footnote 12 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:intention_bias"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;we experience our memories as a kind of coherent story, often with a plot that revolves around our intentions, or those of other people.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
When we think or talk about other people, we try to infer their intentions, but of course we cannot actually know for certain what their intentions are. We only have direct access to &lt;em&gt;our own&lt;/em&gt; intentions, and even these are usually rationalisations, rather than an accurate reflection of the many factors that actually determine our behaviour. Therefore we have a tendency to ascribe good intentions to ourselves (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(psychology)"&gt;rationalisation&lt;/a&gt;), and bad intentions to others (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_attribution_bias"&gt;hostile attribution&lt;/a&gt; bias). The latter is a major driver of aggression toward other people. In general, we are quick to assume intentionality, even in (the rather common) cases when behaviour is unintentional. This is known as &lt;a href="https://www.shortcogs.com/bias/intentionality-bias"&gt;intentionality bias&lt;/a&gt;, and it helps explain why we blame others so easily, and why we are susceptible to conspiracy theories. Robert Sapolsky discusses the causes and consequences of these biases at length in his excellent book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/311787/behave-by-robert-m-sapolsky"&gt;Behave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, especially in chapter 13 (on moral behaviour).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:intention_bias" title="Jump back to footnote 13 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:hypocrite"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t make us hypocrites, it just makes us human.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
A hypocrite is a person who professes beliefs and opinions that he or she does not hold in order to conceal his or her real feelings or motives. This is not what happens if you hold conflicting values. However, in some sense we do conceal such inconsistencies from ourselves, and therefore also from others. This is not an intentional act, it is a form of mental self-protection.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hypocrite" title="Jump back to footnote 14 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:affective_evaluation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have strong feelings about fairness and what constitutes &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
In general, feelings are usually not neutral, they tend to have a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;valence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We experience feelings as positive or negative, although this does depend on context, and we can also feel ambiguity or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approach-avoidance_conflict"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)"&gt;Affective&lt;/a&gt; evaluation&lt;/em&gt;, judging something to be good or bad, is probably a fairly basic feature of conscious feeling. All animals (and even many single-celled organisms) seem to judge things roughly along a basic affective axis of &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; (approach) vs. &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/avoidance-behavior/Protection-reflexes-armour-and-spines"&gt;avoid&lt;/a&gt;) (although, of course, &lt;em&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5548639/"&gt;complicated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). Because we humans are an extremely social species, we have extended our evaluation of &amp;ldquo;good vs. bad&amp;rdquo; to distinguish &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; behaviour in the context of social groups. This is linked to the ways in which we construct social identities (think &amp;ldquo;us vs. them&amp;rdquo;, in which &amp;ldquo;us&amp;rdquo; is more often seen as &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;). Also, humans are unique in that we can come up with &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; to judge actions and values.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:affective_evaluation" title="Jump back to footnote 15 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:social_morality"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we consider &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; is determined mostly by our social environment, by the fundamental values of the people we feel connected to. Such values outline which actions are desirable or unacceptable and what constitutes a rich, meaningful life, as opposed to an empty, meaningless one.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Nearly all of us need to feel connected to what we see as &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;, and we generally try to justify our actions as being in line with our moral values. See &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118748213.ch14"&gt;Josselson &amp;amp; Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; (2015) and &lt;a href="https://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/5127/2/Chapter_1_Michelle_Crossley.pdf"&gt;Crossley&lt;/a&gt; (2002).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:social_morality" title="Jump back to footnote 16 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:sharedvalues"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shared stories are important in this, they communicate shared values, goals and expectations. We can choose to align ourselves with these, or we can oppose them.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Also note that shared values are rarely articulated explicitly by the people we engage with. Rather they are often communicated implicitly through the actions we take and the stories that we share. See &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315559667-16/narrative-psychology-cultural-psychology-1-csaba-pl%C3%A9h"&gt;Pléh&lt;/a&gt; (2018, &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328789225_NARRATIVE_PSYCHOLOGY_AS_CULTURAL_PSYCHOLOGY_1"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:sharedvalues" title="Jump back to footnote 17 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:actors"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are not isolated individuals with purely independent goals and feelings. Instead we are more like actors, engaged in various plots in a world of others.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
See &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118748213.ch14"&gt;Josselson &amp;amp; Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; (2015).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:actors" title="Jump back to footnote 18 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:hero_journey"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearly every text on storytelling goes on to explain this using the Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey. This story structure underlies many myths, popular stories and Hollywood blockbusters.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
In the Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey, the main character has to leave their community or home to face a series of trials. 
The hero eventually returns transformed, with a new understanding. The story arc typically follows a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_structure#Three-act_structure"&gt;three-act structure&lt;/a&gt;. 
The Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey story structure (or &amp;ldquo;monomyth&amp;rdquo;) was popularised by Joseph Campbell in his &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&lt;/em&gt;, which subsequently had a big influence on the work of filmmakers such as George Lucas (e.g. in his &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; films) and on the approach taken by many (especially Western) storytellers. People have since advocated the use of similar story structures in just about any type of storytelling, from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Writer%27s_Journey:_Mythic_Structure_for_Writers"&gt;fiction&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13088627-winning-the-story-wars"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://inquisitivebiologist.com/2019/01/19/book-review-dont-be-such-a-scientist-talking-substance-in-an-age-of-style-second-edition/"&gt;science communication&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hero_journey" title="Jump back to footnote 19 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:alt_structures"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the popularity of the Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey structure makes it easy to overlook that many stories don&amp;rsquo;t actually follow it.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Joseph Cambell&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;one size fits all&amp;rdquo; interpretation of mythology has been widely &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey#Criticism"&gt;criticised&lt;/a&gt; by folklorists, artists and activists. And Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_story_structures"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of story structures does not even mention the Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey: There exists a much bigger diversity when it comes to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_structure"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt; of actual stories, especially outside Western pop culture and foundational myths.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:alt_structures" title="Jump back to footnote 20 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:lifestorytone"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;people who express more positive life stories tend to score better on measures of wellbeing.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
See &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1075/ni.9.1.05bae"&gt;Baerger &amp;amp; McAdams&lt;/a&gt; (1999), and also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118748213.ch14"&gt;Josselson &amp;amp; Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; (2015), &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=lv0aCAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA85&amp;amp;ots=ePHOeujnUA&amp;amp;sig=ihZ4QyxLHfWZoK72nyiWe6cpxI0"&gt;Murray&lt;/a&gt; (2015, &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/download/34918602/C6_Narrative_-_Murray_2007.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1075/ni.16.1.04mca"&gt;McAdams&lt;/a&gt; (2006). For both fiction and their own life stories, most people seem to prefer positive stories over negative ones. There should be struggle of course, but in a positive story the obstacles are eventually overcome.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:lifestorytone" title="Jump back to footnote 21 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:mental_complexity"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are all aspects of &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo;, and they are all important.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
We can see the importance of various mental processes when they fail to operate, for instance when brain damage occurs. Regardless of whether a region is old or new (from an evolutionary perspective), damage to a normally functioning brain &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; leads to worse outcomes. For instance, disabling emotional evaluation doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate some kind of rational superhuman. Rather, loss of emotional &amp;ldquo;gut feeling&amp;rdquo; generally leads to &lt;em&gt;very bad&lt;/em&gt; decisions, and can even result in a complete loss of motivation, as pointed out by Robert Sapolsky in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/311787/behave-by-robert-m-sapolsky"&gt;Behave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And damage to other areas involved in narrative processing (e.g. related to temporal organisation, memory, mental simulation, affective tone, etc.) can cause various kinds of &amp;ldquo;dysnarrativia&amp;rdquo;, problematic states of narrative impairment, examples of which are described by
&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/3685505"&gt;Young &amp;amp; Saver&lt;/a&gt; (2001, &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeffrey-Saver/publication/236709327_The_Neurology_of_Narrative/links/679145d775d4ab477e56c7b8/The-Neurology-of-Narrative.pdf?origin=publication_detail&amp;amp;_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uRG93bmxvYWQiLCJwcmV2aW91c1BhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiJ9fQ"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). They conclude that &amp;ldquo;brain injured individuals may lose their linguistic, mathematic, syllogistic, visuospatial, amnestic, or kinesthetic competencies and still be recognizably the same persons. Individuals who have lost the ability to construct narrative, however, have lost their selves.&amp;rdquo;     &lt;br&gt;
Evolutionarily more recent brain areas include the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which is greatly expanded in mammals, especially in humans (and other primates). One of its major functions is to suppress and expand on automatic behaviour. But the prefrontal cortex would not be able to perform these functions without the older brain systems: it regulates and supplements older systems, rather than replacing them. In fact, as described by Mark Solms in his book &lt;a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/the-hidden-spring"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hidden Spring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, consciousness may well reside in these older, more fundamental brain systems. This implies that consciousness is probably not unique to humans, mammals or even vertebrates. And it also means that &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt; are central to consciousness, and they are therefore fundamental rather than optional. The newer features supplied to us by evolution include the ability to ignore or reflect on feelings, and to override or otherwise regulate emotions and automatic responses, so that they do not end up fully governing our behaviour.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:mental_complexity" title="Jump back to footnote 22 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:hayes"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take for instance the huge 2022 review of psychotherapy methods by Stephen C. Hayes and collaborators. They found that when it comes to mental health, the single most important skill to develop is psychological flexibility.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
After &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.nl/scholar?cluster=18312380402333897238&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0,5&amp;amp;as_vis=1"&gt;studying&lt;/a&gt; 281 results (from an initial set of nearly 55000 studies), Hayes et al. found that one single set of skills proved far more commonly effective than anything else. According to Hayes in his &lt;a href="https://stevenchayes.com/the-most-important-skill-set-in-mental-health-2/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, this skill set &amp;ldquo;was more frequently found than self-esteem; support from friends, family, or your therapist; and even whether or not you have negative, dysfunctional thoughts. The most common pathway of change was your psychological flexibility and mindfulness skills.&amp;rdquo; Hayes goes on to explain: &amp;ldquo;The first pillar of psychological flexibility is awareness. This means noticing what happens in the present moment: What thoughts show up? Which feelings? [&amp;hellip;] The second pillar of psychological flexibility is openness. This means allowing difficult thoughts and painful feelings – exactly as they are [&amp;hellip;] openness is about dropping the internal fight, allowing thoughts and feelings to be what they are – merely thoughts and feelings – without them needing to control you. [&amp;hellip;] The third and final pillar of psychological flexibility is valued engagement. This means knowing what matters to you, and taking steps in this direction. It involves being in contact with your goals – objectives you want to reach or achieve – and your values – those personal qualities you choose to manifest and be guided by, regardless of a specific outcome. These matters need to be freely chosen, rather than being forced on by others, or mindlessly followed out of custom. But once you have clarity about what matters, you can take action to build sustainable habits that make your life more about what gives it meaning.&amp;rdquo;   &lt;br&gt;
The skill set Hayes describes is similar to some of the core teachings of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; and several other traditional philosophies (in the sense of acknowledging the value of awareness and accepting difficult thoughts). Also, these results resonate with writings of several popular authors such as &lt;a href="https://jonathanhaidt.com/"&gt;Jonathan Haidt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.samharris.org/"&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://brenebrown.com/"&gt;Brené Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.matthieuricard.org/en/"&gt;Matthieu Ricard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://markmanson.net/"&gt;Mark Manson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://drgabormate.com/"&gt;Gabor Maté&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://adamgrant.net/"&gt;Adam Grant&lt;/a&gt; and others.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hayes" title="Jump back to footnote 23 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ironrule"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the main social convention that emerged was the &amp;ldquo;iron rule&amp;rdquo;. This rule says that theories are only taken seriously in science if they match empirical observations.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
This interpretation of science is based on the work of philosopher Michael Strevens, which he describes in his book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.strevens.org/scientia"&gt;The Knowledge Machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, in the &lt;a href="https://www.strevens.org/scientia/inextremis.shtml"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Science Is Irrational—and a Good Thing, Too&lt;/em&gt; and on the &lt;em&gt;Jim Rutt Show&lt;/em&gt; podcast, &lt;a href="https://www.jimruttshow.com/michael-strevens/"&gt;episode 106&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ironrule" title="Jump back to footnote 24 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:story_development"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stories work well for us because they combine and structure human feelings, problems, goals and values into a recognisable whole that can be easily copied and modified. This is a powerful ability that humans have, and that we&amp;rsquo;re naturally good at.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
The mental skills involved with narrative thinking and cause and effect prediction do however take some time to develop. Children learn to understand and tell stories at a young age, but before age five the temporal structure of their stories tends to be all over the place, and their sense of causality generally has little to do with reality.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:story_development" title="Jump back to footnote 25 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:propaganda"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the psychological techniques used in modern marketing were originally adapted from 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century war propaganda.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
During the First World War, the US Committee on Public Information (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Public_Information"&gt;CPI&lt;/a&gt; for short) was created to influence public opinion to support the American war effort, using recent insights into mass psychology. The propaganda campaigns created by the CPI proved quite effective, and US propaganda techniques were subsequently studied by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels, to inspire the propaganda efforts of Nazi Germany. Moreover, one of the CPI members, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays"&gt;Edward Bernays&lt;/a&gt;, realised that propaganda techniques based on group psychology could also be employed in peacetime. In the 1920s, Bernays published several books and papers on this subject, including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallizing_Public_Opinion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crystallizing Public Opinion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_(book)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Propaganda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/214599"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manipulating Public Opinion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, thereby kickstarting the field of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"&gt;public relations&lt;/a&gt; (PR). Bernays believed that the &amp;ldquo;masses&amp;rdquo; were not very smart, and therefore that their minds can and should be manipulated by the capable few. Several of his successful accomplishments were rather questionable by today&amp;rsquo;s moral standards, including the &lt;em&gt;Torches of Freedom&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;, designed to boost tobacco sales by encouraging women to smoke cigarettes.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:propaganda" title="Jump back to footnote 26 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Levien van Zon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories are important for how we see the world. 
In my &lt;a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/beyond-optimists-and-pessimists.html"&gt;first article&lt;/a&gt;, I argued that stories act as internal models of the world, supercharged by our ability to share them with others. My &lt;a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/entwined.html"&gt;subsequent post&lt;/a&gt; was about complexity and about science. Although much of our knowledge comes from the pursuit of science, its tools have trouble with so-called &lt;em&gt;complex systems&lt;/em&gt;. Complexity in this context means that there are many interacting parts. The parts of a complex system are hard to separate because their interactions are significant, they cannot simply be ignored or averaged away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I have been a little vague about a number of things. For instance, what do I mean by &amp;ldquo;stories&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;internal models&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;knowledge&amp;rdquo;? And what is the nature of &amp;ldquo;interactions&amp;rdquo; between the parts of a complex system? In this article, I want to make some of these things more concrete. Also, I will show that complexity isn&amp;rsquo;t just there to make our lives difficult, it can actually have an important function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge as explanatory stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the concept that stories are models of the world. Stories are complicated things that are closely tied up with the workings of our mind. They are hard to define and they serve many functions. So for now I will just focus on a common experience: We generally feel that we &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; an event, if we can construct a coherent story of how the event was generated.&lt;sup id="fnref:mentalmodel"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mentalmodel"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Such explanatory stories are often not accurate, of course. Our explanation of an event may be quite different from how the event was &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; generated.&lt;sup id="fnref:explanations"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:explanations"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But regardless of their accuracy, the collection of cause-and-effect stories that we believe to be true does constitute our &lt;em&gt;personal knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, our internal model of how the world works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because a fair number of our causal beliefs are at best inaccurate and at worst plain nonsense, it is useful for a society to have some way to check our shared beliefs. Science can be seen as a collective human effort to figure out whether cause-and-effect stories (usually called &lt;em&gt;theories&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;hypotheses&lt;/em&gt;) actually correspond to processes in the real world. And it turns out that this is not at all easy to establish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to test a causal story is typically through experiment. If we change something in a proposed causal chain, we should see a change in the effect. However it is not always possible to perform direct experiments. For instance, things can be too small or too big to manipulate, like molecules or societies. Or they may be connected to too many other things, as with cells in the human brain. Luckily, people have come up with many ingenious and elaborate ways to establish which causes lead to which effects.&lt;sup id="fnref:causality"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:causality"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ideally we are able to figure out a detailed mechanistic process. By this I mean a description of all the steps &lt;em&gt;through which&lt;/em&gt; certain causes lead to certain effects. Knowing the true (or at least likely) mechanism through which something happens is what we usually regard as &amp;ldquo;understanding&amp;rdquo; in the scientific sense. Having such a &lt;em&gt;mechanistic&lt;/em&gt; description is very powerful, as it may allow us to control things and predict what may happen in the future or in other hypothetical situations.&lt;sup id="fnref:mechanism"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mechanism"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A simple complex system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote &lt;a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/entwined.html"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt;, the classical scientific approach has difficulty with complex systems, because such systems have many significant interactions between their parts. For instance in the human body, in human society or in a natural ecosystem, it is hard to manipulate and study parts in isolation. This would be necessary to clearly determine cause-effect-relationships and understand how such relationships work. Yet if we isolate parts, we change the system we want to study. Moreover, cause and effect may not even be well-defined, because there may be causal loops or &amp;ldquo;feedbacks&amp;rdquo;. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at an example to make clear what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/greenhouse-foodweb.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border: 0px;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a small greenhouse containing a simple ecosystem with three kinds of organisms: plants, slugs and hedgehogs. This is a very simple complex system. It is not hard to describe the interactions here: the slugs eat the plants, and the hedgehogs eat the slugs. These interactions are significant in the sense that they are literally a matter of life or death for the parties involved. Hence this system is complex in at least two aspects: interactions are significant and the parts thus behave differently if you separate them. Whether specific interactions are positive or negative depends on our perspective. Clearly the slugs negatively affect the plants, but we can also say that the plants positively affect the slugs (and indirectly the hedgehogs). For an outside observer the two ways of seeing the interaction are more or less equivalent, for the plants and slugs they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stability and circular causes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the interactions are easily described here, the behaviour of the system is not so easy to describe in terms of causes and effects. What happens for instance if the slugs eat &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the plants? There will be a brief explosion of slugs and perhaps hedgehogs, after which all animals will die of hunger. But while such a slug-armageddon is certainly possible, the little ecosystem can also be perfectly stable. The hedgehogs can keep the slugs in check, giving the plants an opportunity to grow, and the limited number of slugs will in turn limit the hedgehogs. As you can see, there are loops of causality here: the slugs affect the hedgehogs, which in turn affect the slugs, which affects both plants and hedgehogs, and so on. This is an example of circular causality, or what are often called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"&gt;feedback loops&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback loops can be tricky to describe, because there is no clear separation of cause and effect. Do the slugs limit the hedgehogs, or do the hedgehogs limit the slugs? The answer is yes. They limit each other. The relationship between slugs and hedgehogs is an example of what is called a &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;balancing&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;attenuating&lt;/em&gt;) feedback. A familiar example of negative feedback in human engineering is the thermostat, which turns up the heating if it becomes too cold, and turns it down if it becomes too warm. Negative feedback is in many ways positive, because it can prevent things from getting out of hand, so it tends to provide stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other common type of feedback loop is called &lt;em&gt;amplifying&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;reinforcing&lt;/em&gt; or simply &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; feedback. As you will probably have guessed, positive feedback isn&amp;rsquo;t always positive. An example is the &amp;ldquo;rich get richer&amp;rdquo; effect: People who have more money have more opportunities to acquire further wealth than people who have less money. Therefore the rich tend to become richer and inequality in societies will tend to increase unless active measures are taken to prevent the concentration of wealth and power. Positive feedback is very powerful, it drives exponential growth and can rapidly amplify things. But in the absence of stabilising mechanisms it potentially causes instability. We depend on it for our nervous and immune systems to function (among many other things), and it drives biological evolution and economic growth. But it can also lead to explosions, economic depression, ecosystem collapse, runaway climate change and social revolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding complex behaviour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our little greenhouse. Because &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; human language is imprecise and has difficulty with circular causation, there is a limit to how well we can describe what goes on in this small system. This is despite the fact that our greenhouse only contains three species and our story ignores many other things that are also important (like the sunlight, water, nutrients and microbes that are required for the plants to grow). Our description doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide enough information to predict, for instance, whether a given constellation of slugs and hedgehogs will destabilise the system by eating too much. For this, we will need a more precise description of what is going on. One thing we can do is construct a mathematical model that describes the main interactions between the three species. I will not bother you here with the details, you can see what this looks like in the footnotes if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.&lt;sup id="fnref:gorydetails"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gorydetails"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Suffice it to say a mathematical description is much more compact than our descriptive story, and it allows us to make very specific predictions. We can use it to determine how much the animals can eat, or how fast the plants need to grow, for the system to remain stable. In this sense it is a richer description. Although to make the mathematics manageable it also leaves out a lot of details. These details may or may not be important for the questions we want the model to answer. Like our descriptive story, a mathematical model is a simplification. In many ways it is a very poor description of what &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; goes on. All our models, whether stories, pictures, mathematical formulas or computer simulations, are tools for understanding the things that happen in the world. They are necessarily simplifications, and they are never as rich and subtle as the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exploding hairballs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine trying to understand and describe an actual, natural ecosystem that isn&amp;rsquo;t an artificial greenhouse with only three species. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound"&gt;Puget Sound&lt;/a&gt; is an estuary in Washington State, adjacent to the cities of Seattle and Tacoma. This is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/puget-sound-overview.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border: 0px;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is a picture of the main species groups and their interactions in the central basin of the Puget Sound ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/ecopath-diagram-puget-sound.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border: 0px;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck. Clearly this is a more complex complex system. Even though the diagram shown above is still much simplified, human language is no longer an effective tool to describe all the interactions shown here. The picture above actually represents a &lt;a href="https://www.eopugetsound.org/articles/quantitative-models-including-ecopath-take-food-web-studies-higher-level-analysis"&gt;computer model&lt;/a&gt;. This model contains a mathematical description of relations between groups of species, such as what and how much they eat.&lt;sup id="fnref:ewemodel"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ewemodel"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These numbers in turn are based on observations and measurements of what actual creatures do. You can imagine how much work goes into constructing such a model. And this is not even a very complicated system, as ecosystems go. Moreover, the model mostly describes relatively big organisms. It lumps the huge diversity of micro-organisms&amp;mdash;which constitute an ecosystem onto itself&amp;mdash;into a few large groups such as &amp;ldquo;bacteria&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;phytoplankton&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine trying to make a model of what goes on in the human body. The Puget Sound ecosystem model describes 65 species groups. The human body consists of roughly 30 trillion cells of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_cell_types"&gt;more than 400&lt;/a&gt; different types, plus another 38 trillion or so &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome"&gt;microbes&lt;/a&gt; belonging to more than a thousand different species. Our own cells interact with this personal ecosystem of resident micro-organisms in ways that are essential for our health but are poorly understood. Furthermore, the internal workings of our cells depend on more than eighty-thousand different proteins and on a lot of other types of molecules, many of which we don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about yet. Much of what goes on in our body is decentralised and self-organising, although some of it is coordinated by our nervous system, which has somewhere in the order of 100 trillion neuronal connections.&lt;sup id="fnref:synapses"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:synapses"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The human body is so mind-bogglingly complex that there is no way a single person could understand how it all works, exactly. Luckily we don&amp;rsquo;t need to know all the details in order to operate our body. But for medical science this complexity does present a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting lost in details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we almost always see complexity as a problem, and with good reason. If we want to control things, we need to know how they work (at least more or less). If you want a doctor to treat a serious medical condition, it helps a lot if they know what causes the condition, and what happens if you treat it with a certain pharmaceutical drug. Of course trial-and-error can be a valid approach, but it is much more useful to know causal mechanisms (and as a patient I would much prefer the latter). And luckily we do know quite a few mechanisms, the exact processes by which certain things happen in our body, often down to the level of molecules. But figuring these out has taken a gigantic, time-consuming and very costly effort by millions of researchers collecting data and doing experiments for more than a century. And given how much we still don&amp;rsquo;t know, the end of this effort is nowhere near in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/complexity-tangle-2-small.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border: 0px;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems is that merely collecting detailed information isn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient for understanding how things work. As science writer Philip Ball points out in his book &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://how-life-works.philipball.co.uk/"&gt;How Life Works&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, it clearly isn&amp;rsquo;t the case that all details matter. If &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; details were important, life would be utterly fragile in the face of disturbance and damage. But life is remarkably resilient, so buried somewhere in the endless complex details there must be robust patterns and processes that keep things running, even under difficult conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we collect a lot of detailed observations and focus mostly on these, we easily lose sight of the big picture. We risk missing the forest for the trees, missing the patterns and processes that actually matter most. Unfortunately it isn&amp;rsquo;t always clear where we should look for these &amp;ldquo;aspects that matter&amp;rdquo;. For several decades it was believed that for living beings, &lt;em&gt;genetics&lt;/em&gt; is what matters most. This is an understandable belief: Genes contain much of the information that we pass on between generations, and this gets acted on by evolution. So surely our genome must provide a kind of &amp;ldquo;blueprint&amp;rdquo; for how to build an organism?&lt;sup id="fnref:blueprint"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:blueprint"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If we can just understand how to read and interpret this information, then all the other messy molecular and cellular details may prove less important. Or so we believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Complex patterns for robustness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project"&gt;Human Genome Project&lt;/a&gt; started in 1990. It aimed to read all our DNA so that we could catalogue our genes and associate them with their function. But when the first results came in a decade later, they were quite different from what was expected. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a neat picture of genes determining certain functions, or even &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; encoding protein molecules with clear functions. Rather, our genetic content seemed a bewildering mess of baroque complexity. Even two decades on, it is still unclear what most genetic elements &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo;. In the years after the first genome datasets were published, the messy data did turn out to contain &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network#Local_feature"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt;:
For instance, some combinations of genes were found to behave in ways similar to electronic circuits. Such &lt;a href="https://biocircuits.github.io/chapters/01_intro_to_circuit_design.html"&gt;biological circuits&lt;/a&gt; often have clear functions. They can oscillate or switch between states in various ways.&lt;sup id="fnref:biocircuits"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:biocircuits"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These circuits are very common in single-celled organisms, but alas, much less common in humans and other multicellular organisms. The &amp;ldquo;wiring&amp;rdquo; of the molecular network encoded by our genes actually resembles the brain more than it does a set of simple circuits. An electronic circuit processes electrical signals. Similarly, our molecular networks also seem to direct and process information, encoded in chemical, electrical and mechanical signals. But the information doesn&amp;rsquo;t neatly flow in one direction or stay in one part of the system. Instead, like in the brain, the information seems to go everywhere, and it can have effects all over the organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we make sense of this? Why is our body (and that of other multicellular organisms) organised in such a strange and seemingly chaotic and inefficient way? Is this just the historical legacy of millions of years of random mutation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some of it is an evolutionary legacy, but certainly not all of it. Rather, it probably isn&amp;rsquo;t a coincidence that chemical interaction networks in our body show similarities to the way our brain is wired. Our neural networks are wired to integrate and process information in ways that are relatively flexible and robust. These networks need to be somewhat insensitive to noise, damage and small details. The same is probably true for the molecular networks encoded by our genome. Individual genes &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have an effect on the way information is processed by these networks. But the effect is typically small and often it&amp;rsquo;s hard to predict beforehand what the effect will be. 
The fact that most gene mutations have only minor effects, provides the system with some degree of robustness. This also makes the process of evolution a lot easier. 
And the unpredictability of the effects is an advantage, given the existence of viruses and other pathogens. These parasites constantly try to co-opt our molecular machinery for their own purposes. And this would be a lot easier for them if the workings of our biology were transparent and predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All living beings have to survive in a world that is full of noise, variation and elements that can inflict damage. If our biology was sensitive to all of this, it would never be able to build a well-functioning complex individual from a single cell, and make it last for 80 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Details can matter, but context matters more&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does all of this tell us about how we should deal with complex systems? First, it seems that the role of details in such systems is complicated. If we ignore details, we risk coming up with &amp;ldquo;mystical&amp;rdquo; cause-and-effect stories. Such stories have no clear mechanism, no clearly defined &lt;em&gt;process through which&lt;/em&gt; causes lead to effects. It may take away our uncertainty to attribute effects to deities, the universe, black boxes or invisible hands. This in itself can be useful. We dislike uncertainty, and even false certainties may aid us in many ways, for instance by binding social groups together.&lt;sup id="fnref:certainties"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:certainties"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But often vague, mystical explanations don&amp;rsquo;t help us in solving the actual problems we face. For this, we need a mechanistic understanding of the processes through which things happen. And to understand such a process, we need to know about relevant details. If we say &amp;ldquo;everything is connected&amp;rdquo;, this may be true but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t further our understanding. To understand, we need to figure out &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; connections are &lt;em&gt;actually important&lt;/em&gt;, and how they influence the behaviour of a system. But even if we do this, we should be aware that our knowledge will always be incomplete. We will usually oversimplify, and miss connections that are important in a certain context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover as written before, if we focus mostly on details, we may lose sight of the bigger picture. Especially when dealing with living systems, we need to zoom out occasionally and wonder &lt;em&gt;what a system is supposed to be doing&lt;/em&gt;. What are its goals, which things matter for this, and what is their context?&lt;sup id="fnref:systemgoals"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:systemgoals"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In a living system, the way in which details relate to the whole, can be compared to the structure of human language: If you focus just on letters or on letter shapes, language seems a bewildering mess of small details. It isn&amp;rsquo;t until you zoom out to words that things start to make some sense. But to fully comprehend language, you need the words to interact with each other and with grammar in sentences. These eventually interact with our mood, knowledge and experience in paragraphs and stories. Words and letters do matter in all of this, but a sentence can remain comprehensible if we remove or substitute words, and words can remain comprehensible if we change or remove letters. Moreover, entire languages can evolve significantly and rapidly while still remaining functional. Like language, the way life works has to be both adaptable and robust. Details do matter, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say beforehand which details do and which don&amp;rsquo;t. One has to comprehend the larger-scale patterns to understand the role of details.&lt;sup id="fnref:causalemergence"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:causalemergence"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The fragile, the robust and the adaptive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to realise that what we often see as messy, inefficient complexity can actually have a function. We tend to dislike complexity. It makes things harder to understand, manage and optimise. We prefer clear chains of cause and effect, which we can more easily communicate, understand and modify. When confronted with a complex system, we mostly seek to make it simpler. But in evolved, living systems, complexity is a feature rather than a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, good design doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be complex, but it needs to be both robust and adaptive if it is to survive in the long term. The essayist and mathematician &lt;a href="https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com"&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb&lt;/a&gt; has gone a step further and proposed the term &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility"&gt;antifragile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This describes things that do not just persist under adverse conditions (robustness) and are able to recover (resilience), but that actually &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; some adversity to function well and get better over time (which requires adaptation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans are quite good at optimising things for a narrow set of functions and conditions. We often design structures that seem efficient and in which causes and effects are easy to understand. But these structures also tend to be fragile, especially when conditions are no longer &amp;ldquo;optimal&amp;rdquo;. 
If we remove or damage any part of such a fragile system, it no longer works well.   &lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, when we design things to be robust, we tend to do it by &lt;em&gt;overdesigning&lt;/em&gt;. We make a best guess of worse case scenarios (say, the maximum strain a bridge has to endure). Subsequently we apply a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_of_safety"&gt;safety factor&lt;/a&gt;: we design the structure so that it can withstand two or three times the worst-case strain. This approach works well, provided of course our calculations are correct, the scenarios don&amp;rsquo;t become outdated, we didn&amp;rsquo;t overlook possible causes of failure and the structure we design is well-maintained.&lt;sup id="fnref:designfailures"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:designfailures"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally evolved systems seem to do something quite different. They tend to have many complex causal loops that are hard to understand. But such loops do have a function in stabilising the system and in making it less sensitive to noise and damage. Such systems tend to be robust. If they weren&amp;rsquo;t, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t last very long in a world that can often be adverse and unpredictable. They are able to recover from damage and adapt relatively quickly to new conditions.&lt;sup id="fnref:adaptationfailure"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:adaptationfailure"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having antifragility built into a system nearly always makes it harder to comprehend (in the words of the late &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Scott"&gt;James C. Scott&lt;/a&gt;, it is &lt;em&gt;less &lt;a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/"&gt;legible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). Still this approach is often more efficient and is certainly more adaptable than overdesigning structures with large safety margins to obtain robustness.&lt;sup id="fnref:overdesign"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:overdesign"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And a dynamic &amp;ldquo;antifragile&amp;rdquo; approach is certainly more robust than designing systems that are so streamlined for &amp;ldquo;efficiency&amp;rdquo; that they fail at the least sign of trouble. We overdesign bridges, power plants, cars and aeroplanes, which is good. We streamline our supply chains and our food production system, which is worrisome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we seriously want to make our societies and our infrastructure sustainable in the long term (by which I mean: longer than a few decades), we will need to broaden our view to how life does things. We have currently organised our societies in ways that will probably not fare well under big changes of any kind, especially if such changes are sudden and unexpected. Life has survived such challenges many times, and some past societies have done so as well. It would be wise to learn from the design principles and processes through which living systems manage to persist, rather than to assume that we know better, or to ignore such mechanisms altogether. At the very least we should start to accept and appreciate complexity. We should pay more attention to patterns and processes that provide robustness, such as negative feedback loops. But we can do much better, perhaps we can learn to use some principles of adaptive, antifragile complex systems in ways that are beneficial to the long-term wellbeing of humans and non-humans alike.&lt;/p&gt;

This book is a classic introduction to &amp;ldquo;systems thinking&amp;rdquo;, written by the lead author of &lt;a href="https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/"&gt;The Limits To Growth&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to get more of a feel for thinking in terms of interactions, positive and negative feedbacks and dynamic patterns, this is a useful book. Moreover, Dana Meadows makes a number of important points in the book. She argues that we need to think in patterns and mechanisms, rather than in separate events. She highlights the role of nonlinear relationships and delays in producing surprising (and often unpleasant) results, as well as the important effects of limited stocks and limited information. She notes that just searching for statistical correlations doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help us much in understanding what a system does, and how or why it does it. However, I do have a few issues with the text. For instance, terms like &amp;ldquo;feedback loop&amp;rdquo; are used very often and sometimes in a very broad sense. If you call nearly every process a feedback loop, the term starts to become somewhat meaningless. More seriously, some of the terminology, definitions and proposed mechanisms are vague, sloppy and/or inconsistent. Especially when talking about things such as complexity, resilience, goals and self-organisation, Meadows&amp;rsquo; explanations sometimes mystify rather than clarify these subjects. Finally, viewing the world in terms of dynamical stock-and-flow systems (as this book does) is certainly useful for understanding systems, but truly complex systems are not always best understood this way.  &lt;br&gt;

Readable, interesting and well-researched, this is by far the best book I have encountered on the complex relationship between animals (including humans) and their resident microbes. Many authors have argued that we should stop talking and thinking about microbes mostly in terms of their elimination. Ed Yong proposes that we replace the outdated &amp;ldquo;war metaphor&amp;rdquo; of fighting microbes by a more friendly metaphor of gardening or wildlife management. We should actively promote microbes that are useful and only reduce the occasional &amp;ldquo;weeds&amp;rdquo;, microbes that are out of place and cause problems. Indeed, our own body and immune system seem designed to do precisely this: Rather than indiscriminately killing microbes, our immune system actively &lt;em&gt;manages&lt;/em&gt; the microbial ecosystems on and inside our bodies. Each of us carries at least as many microbes as we have cells in our body. Collectively, the genes of this &lt;em&gt;microbiome&lt;/em&gt; greatly outnumber our own genes. Our body actively communicates and coordinates with our resident microbes, and it depends on them to work well. Our microbes allow us to rapidly adapt to different foods, to ward off pathogens and to calibrate our immune system. Many diseases are associated with a disturbed microbiome, a state called &lt;em&gt;dysbiosis&lt;/em&gt;. However, it is currently unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause or an effect of disease. Quite possibly it is both. And also in other ways, our relationship with microbes is complicated and doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit simple narratives of pure conflict or cooperation.   &lt;br&gt;
Yong has also talked about the microbiome &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOymDhGxS9Q"&gt;at the Royal Institution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/08/18/490432969/eating-yogurt-is-not-enough-rebalancing-the-ecosystem-of-the-microbes-within-us"&gt;at the NPR Fresh Air&lt;/a&gt; radio show.   &lt;br&gt;

Humans are big users of metaphor. To understand unfamiliar or abstract things we describe them in terms of concepts that we are more familiar with. To understand how living systems work, we often describe them in terms of factories, machines, computers or other structures built by humans. In this very important book, science writer Phil Ball points out that such metaphors are often unhelpful, because the way in which living systems work is very different from how we humans design things. For instance, our genes are not at all comparable to a blueprint or a computer program. Our genome doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully specify how our body is built or how it operates. The word &amp;ldquo;mechanism&amp;rdquo; usually evokes images of machines, in which interactions are neatly defined. But Ball points out that the mechanisms through which biology operates tend to be very &amp;ldquo;messy&amp;rdquo;, and often involve interactions between various levels of organisation. Life needs to process information, and it does so in ways that look weird and complicated to us but that have proven to be robust and flexible in the adverse and noisy environments in which life operates.    &lt;br&gt;
A lot of what I wrote in the article above is based on the ideas put forth by Ball in this book. Phil Ball also talks about these subjects in the Big Biology podcast, &lt;a href="https://www.bigbiology.org/episodes/2024/4/4/ep-119-biology-as-its-own-metaphor-with-phil-ball"&gt;episode 119&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

The mammalian immune system is a good example of a system that isn&amp;rsquo;t merely complex, but that absolutely &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; complexity to function. It has to be adaptive, it would not work without positive feedback and it requires a great variety of negative feedback loops to stop immune responses from getting out of hand. At least as important: if it were too simple, pathogens would immediately find ways to defeat or avoid it. Of all complex systems we know about, the (human) immune system is arguably one of the most complex, and written accounts of how it works are generally close to unreadable. This book by Philipp Dettmer is a rare exception. It manages to convey the immense complexity of the immune system while still being readable and amusing (despite its liberal use of war metaphors and violent imagery, which I find a little unfortunate).   &lt;br&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:mentalmodel"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piles of books and articles have been written on what constitutes a story or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"&gt;narrative&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, a narrative is considered to be some kind of account of related events or experiences, usually involving people. Such definitions tend to hide the fact that we use stories not just to communicate events or experiences, but also to make sense of them. We don&amp;rsquo;t just share and consume stories, we constantly construct them as well. This process is known as &lt;em&gt;emplotment&lt;/em&gt;: the assembly of events into a narrative with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)"&gt;plot&lt;/a&gt;, which establishes cause and effect. As Paul Armstrong suggests in his book &lt;a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12296/stories-and-brain"&gt;Stories and the Brain&lt;/a&gt;, we largely do this automatically and unconsciously, our brain links perceived effects to their perceived causes. This way, we transform our experience into familiar narrative patterns. The narratives we construct and recognise are strongly influenced by culture, but our narratives can also end up influencing culture. Collectively, we construct and use narratives to make sense of the world. This is one way in which our mind constructs a &amp;ldquo;model of the world&amp;rdquo;.  &lt;br&gt;
Apart from consciously present narratives, there are many other ways in which our mind and body contain and create models of the outside world. Unconsciously we learn all kinds of patterns (think of language and motor coordination, but also &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition"&gt;intuition&lt;/a&gt; and the skills to be good at games), and we have many built-in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instinct"&gt;instincts&lt;/a&gt;. Some aspects of the world are encoded much deeper into our physiology. For instance, the biological clocks in our body quite accurately reproduce the time that it takes our planet to rotate around its axis. Our body uses this internal model of day-length to organise all kinds of internal housekeeping tasks. All organisms have models of the outside world built into their physiology to some extent, even single-celled microbes. But the neurological models that we animals construct can be much more elaborate, and they have another clear advantage when it comes to adaptability: They can be updated rapidly with new information. Or in normal language: We can learn things, and we can do so relatively quickly.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:mentalmodel" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:explanations"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our explanation of an event may be quite different from how the event was actually generated.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
There are many examples of very serious scientific theories that later proved to be incorrect. As recent as 150 years ago, the mainstream view in medical science was that cholera, bubonic plague and many other diseases were caused by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory"&gt;miasma&lt;/a&gt;, a noxious form of &amp;ldquo;bad air&amp;rdquo; emanating from rotting organic matter. And until the beginning of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century the consensus view in physics was that electromagnetic waves travelled through an invisible space-filling substance called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether"&gt;ether or æther&lt;/a&gt;. (Among some physicists this idea is actually making a comeback in a new form, to explain dark matter or quantum effects.)  &lt;br&gt;
Inaccurate theories are not just an academic problem, they can have real and serious effects. In the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, misama theory helped promote the construction of sewer systems, as well as Florence Nightingale&amp;rsquo;s beneficial practice of ventilating hospital wards (which helps get rid of airborne pathogens and replaces them with their more useful cousins). Both of these things were good (although not because of miasma). But the theory, which was already formulated in ancient Greece, also held back the effective prevention of infectious diseases for more than two millennia. The London-based physician &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow"&gt;John Snow&lt;/a&gt; proposed in 1849 that Cholera may spread through contaminated drinking water. Despite providing evidence for this that actually stopped a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak"&gt;Cholera outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in 1854, his theory was rejected by officials and most experts. Around the same time, the Hungarian researcher &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis"&gt;Ignaz Semmelweis&lt;/a&gt; proposed that it might be a good idea for doctors to wash their hands and instruments before treating patients. Despite also providing empirical evidence, he was ridiculed by the medical community and eventually referred to a mental institution.   &lt;br&gt;
Outside of science, conspiracy theories are probably the most glaring example of explanations that are attractive to many people but are unlikely to be an accurate representation of reality. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke"&gt;David Icke&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s theory that an inter-dimensional race of blood-drinking, shape-shifting reptilian beings have hijacked our societies would seem to be a harmless science fiction story, if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/07/conspiracy-theory-paranoia-aliens-illuminati-beyonce-vaccines-cliven-bundy-jfk"&gt;millions of people&lt;/a&gt; earnestly believe it to be true. Icke proposes that we defeat our scaly overlords by filling our hearts with love, to deprive the reptilians of the negative energy that they seek. As solutions go, this could certainly be worse. Other conspiracy theories have had rather more violent consequences, causing millions to be killed in pogroms, the Holocaust, witch-hunts and similar acts of persecution and &amp;ldquo;punishment&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:explanations" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:causality"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luckily, people have come up with many ingenious and elaborate ways to establish which causes lead to which effects.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Techniques to determine cause and effect are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference"&gt;causal inference&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_analysis"&gt;causal analysis&lt;/a&gt;. In simple experiments we may be able to observe cause and effect fairly directly. But medical studies involve complex physiological systems that are influenced by many different factors. To be able to say anything about the effect of medical interventions, studies are usually performed in the form of a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"&gt;Randomised Controlled Trial&lt;/a&gt; or RCT. An RCT attempts to isolate the effect of a treatment by trying to statistically separate true effects from &amp;ldquo;confounding influences&amp;rdquo;. Of course this approach is only possible if we can conduct such trials in the first place. Or if we have data on &amp;ldquo;natural experiments&amp;rdquo;, that involve two situations that differ in some crucial aspect but are otherwise sufficiently comparable. Unfortunately there are many situations in which experimental intervention is impossible. It is considered unethical to test something on a large group of people if we suspect that it will damage their health or wellbeing. And we cannot perform experiments on very large systems, such as countries or the climate system. We can also not travel back in time to do controlled experiments under past conditions. In such cases, one common approach is to collect evidence for or against some proposed causal relation from as many &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; sources as possible. We cannot conduct a controlled trial to test whether smoking increases one&amp;rsquo;s risk of developing lung cancer or chronic disease, because we cannot ask people to smoke for several decades to see what happens. But already in 1964, based on many different lines of evidence and a set of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria"&gt;criteria&lt;/a&gt; proposed by epidemiologist Bradford Hill, the US Surgeon General concluded that smoking causes lung cancer. Similarly, determining causality in climate science is based on comparing many lines of evidence, including studies of past climates and the outcome of many different kinds of computer simulations. There are also more formal approaches, which allow fairly complicated &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_model"&gt;causal models&lt;/a&gt; to be explicitly formulated and tested using statistical data.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:causality" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:mechanism"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having such a mechanistic description is very powerful&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Using the terms &amp;ldquo;mechanism&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mechanistic&amp;rdquo; can perhaps be a little misleading here, because these terms can mean different things. In this article I use &amp;ldquo;mechanism&amp;rdquo; to mean &lt;em&gt;the process by which something is done or functions&lt;/em&gt;, in a fairly broad sense. However, the main definition in many dictionaries is something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;a system of parts working together in a machine&amp;rdquo;. Worse, some dictionaries define &amp;ldquo;mechanistic&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;thinking of living things as if they were machines&amp;rdquo;, which is more or less the opposite of my view. My use of terms such as &lt;em&gt;mechanism&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mechanistic&lt;/em&gt; explicitly includes causal processes that function very differently from how we generally design our machines. Some of the issues around the meaning of &amp;ldquo;mechanism&amp;rdquo; in science are discussed in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/683446"&gt;Skillings (2015)&lt;/a&gt;. Machine-like mechanisms function in a well-defined and highly ordered system with sharp boundaries, and involve clear sequential steps. They have a simple flow of causation. But especially in complex systems, many mechanisms do not meet all or even any of these criteria, for instance because they are stochastic, distributed and/or have many feedbacks. An example of such a complex mechanism is evolution by natural selection.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:mechanism" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:gorydetails"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible mathematical model of our little greenhouse ecosystem would be the following:
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$ 
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l}
\frac{\mathrm{d} P}{\mathrm{d} t} = aP - bPS\\ 
\frac{\mathrm{d} S}{\mathrm{d} t} = cPS - dHS\\ 
\frac{\mathrm{d} H}{\mathrm{d} t} = fHS - g 
\end{array}
\right. 
$$&lt;/div&gt;
This particular model is known as a &lt;a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~morrow/336_16/2016papers/lalith.pdf"&gt;three-species Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model&lt;/a&gt;, it is a slightly extended version of the &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; two-species &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations"&gt;Lotka-Volterra model&lt;/a&gt; familiar to most students of biology (and some economists). It belongs to a class known as dynamical population models, which are based on sets of differential equations. In this case, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; are the population numbers of plants, slugs and hedgehogs, &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is the plant growth rate, &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; is the rate at which hedgehogs die and &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; through &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; are &amp;ldquo;rate constants&amp;rdquo; that represent interaction strength and conversion efficiency. To learn more about such models, you can check out the material of the &lt;a href="https://tbb.bio.uu.nl/rdb/bm/index.html"&gt;Biological Modeling&lt;/a&gt; course at Utrecht University (which I helped teach for several years). This class of models is also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_mass_action"&gt;mass-action&lt;/a&gt; models, and these are used among other things to describe chemical reactions. When applied to biological populations, it basically assumes that individual organisms behave as randomly interacting particles in a well-mixed environment. It also assumes that interactions &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be averaged, the model doesn&amp;rsquo;t really describe individuals but only groups. Despite these simplifying (and implicit) assumptions, these models are quite useful for analysing when a system will be stable and when it will not be. The particular formulation of a predator-prey population model given here can however be problematic for this purpose. The formulas above don&amp;rsquo;t include self-limitation within species, due to competition between individuals. Therefore they have a tendency to predict overshoot, resulting in oscillations, in cases where real ecosystems would probably be much more stable. In fact, the Lotka-Volterra model is famous precisely for showing that populations can oscillate. However, if we make the model more realistic by adding additional terms to the model for self-limitation, such oscillations become much less common.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:gorydetails" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ewemodel"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a description of how the Puget Sound food web model was constructed, see &lt;a href="https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/3751/"&gt;Harvey et al. (2010)&lt;/a&gt;, ‘A Mass-Balance Model for Evaluating Food Web Structure and Community-Scale Indicators in the Central Basin of Puget Sound’.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ewemodel" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:synapses"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;our nervous system, which has somewhere in the order of 100 trillion neuronal connections&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
This is a very conservative estimate and probably too low. Common estimates for the number of synapses in the human brain are &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/new-field-neuroscience-aims-map-connections-brain"&gt;100&lt;/a&gt;, 150, &lt;a href="https://sevenandahalflessons.com/notes/500_trillion_connections"&gt;500&lt;/a&gt; or 1000 trillion. Exact numbers are unknown for the brain, let alone for the entire nervous system. In any case, it is clear that our nervous system has &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of connections.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:synapses" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:blueprint"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So surely our genome must provide a kind of &amp;ldquo;blueprint&amp;rdquo; for how to build an organism?&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
We tend to think of our genes in terms of a blueprint or a computer program, which fully specifies how to build a human. In &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://how-life-works.philipball.co.uk/"&gt;How Life Works&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, Philip Ball points out that this isn&amp;rsquo;t a good metaphor. One problem is that it rests upon a black-box concept of &amp;ldquo;gene action&amp;rdquo;, an almost mystical mechanism that is supposed to translate the genetic instructions into physiology. But the actual relationship between genes and physiology seems to be much more complex. Actual human development depends a lot on physical interactions between cells, on self-organising patterns and dynamic attractors and on complex regulatory networks in which separate genes play only a fairly minor role. Some genes do specify building blocks, and individual genes can perhaps influence some parameters of the system. But by itself the genome does not fully specify an organism.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:blueprint" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:biocircuits"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;biological circuits often have clear functions.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
For instance, so-called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_forward_(control)"&gt;feed-forward circuits&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://biocircuits.github.io/chapters/04_ffls.html#The-feedforward-loop-is-overrepresented-in-natural-transcriptional-networks"&gt;over-represented&lt;/a&gt; in the gene regulation networks of especially single-celled organisms. There exist &lt;a href="https://biocircuits.github.io/chapters/04_ffls.html#There-are-many-kinds-of-FFLs"&gt;various types&lt;/a&gt; of such circuits with somewhat different properties. For instance the type-1 coherent feed-forward loop (C1-FFL) acts as a switch with a &lt;a href="https://biocircuits.github.io/chapters/04_ffls.html#The-C1-FFL-circuit-enables-sign-sensitive-delay"&gt;delay&lt;/a&gt; in switching on, but no delay in switching off. Its function is to &lt;a href="https://biocircuits.github.io/chapters/04_ffls.html#Sign-sensitive-delay-is-observed-experimentally"&gt;ignore short pulses&lt;/a&gt; of the activation signal, and to only switch on when the input is present for a longer period, thus filtering out noise. Other common biological circuits act for instance as &lt;a href="https://biocircuits.github.io/chapters/04_ffls.html#The-I1-FFL-with-AND-logic-is-a-pulse-generator"&gt;pulse generators&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://biocircuits.github.io/chapters/07_signal_amplification.html#Amplifiers:-the-middle-managers-of-biological-circuitry"&gt;amplifiers&lt;/a&gt; or as &lt;a href="https://biocircuits.github.io/chapters/09_repressilator.html"&gt;oscillators&lt;/a&gt; (which for instance drive our &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_clock"&gt;biological clocks&lt;/a&gt;). What all biological circuits have in common is that their operation tends to be fairly robust to noise and to some degree of genetic change (although genetic variation can lead to variation in &amp;ldquo;tuning&amp;rdquo; of such circuits).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:biocircuits" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:certainties"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We dislike uncertainty, and even false certainties may aid us in many ways, for instance by binding social groups together.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
The social psychology of uncertainty management is discussed, among other places, in this &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195320916.003.008"&gt;book chapter&lt;/a&gt; by Kees van den Bos (2009, &lt;a href="https://www.biknotes.com/_files/ugd/b8b6dc_1e8426d7b4ca49dd8af5805622078a21.pdf#page=204"&gt;read PDF here&lt;/a&gt;). He argues that people commonly experience personal uncertainty to be an alarming situation. When confronted with uncertainty, rather than looking for contemplation and introspection, people generally look for situations or explanatory stories that offer them a quick way out of uncertainty. Often, such explanatory stories are related to ideologies or other worldviews that are shared by many people.   &lt;br&gt;
In &lt;a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/"&gt;Sapiens&lt;/a&gt;, historian Yuval Noah Harari introduces the concept of “shared fictions”. These include explanatory stories which are not necessarily &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; or accurate, but which we collectively believe in. And because of this, such fictions end up having real power in the world, through our collective actions. Shared fictions reduce personal uncertainty and increase group cohesion. They are very powerful tools to coordinate collective action within human societies, and they play an important role in binding societies together.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:certainties" title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:systemgoals"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need to zoom out occasionally and wonder what a system is supposed to be doing. What are its goals?&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Not all systems have explicit goals. For example, an ecosystem isn&amp;rsquo;t centrally controlled, it emerges from the interactions between separate organisms and species. The individual organisms that make up an ecosystem do have agency and goals, and the dynamics of an ecosystem are at least in part determined by the goals of the individuals in it. Also, an ecosystem can end up having functions, such as managing water and recycling nutrients. These functions can be critically important for the individuals that make up the system. So for an ecosystem we can ask: What are its functions?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:systemgoals" title="Jump back to footnote 11 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:causalemergence"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One has to comprehend the larger-scale patterns to understand the role of details.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
This is related to the phenomenon of &lt;em&gt;emergence&lt;/em&gt; that I discussed in my &lt;a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/entwined.html"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;. In a simple mechanism, say a machine with cogs, the behaviour of the whole can be fully or mostly traced back to the behaviour of the parts. However in complex biological and social systems, as well as in language, the whole also strongly &lt;em&gt;influences&lt;/em&gt; the behaviour (or the meaning) of the parts. Causality doesn&amp;rsquo;t just flow upwards, from parts to higher levels of organisation. It also flows downwards from higher to lower levels. Phil Ball calls this &lt;em&gt;causal spreading&lt;/em&gt;, the spreading of causation across levels of organisation. In physiology and molecular biology this is actually a necessity. At the level of molecules, the world is very noisy and structures are unreliable. Other and more stable organisational structures arise out of the interaction of molecules, this is emergence. When these emergent structures, in turn, strongly constrain and influence their building blocks, this is &lt;em&gt;causal emergence&lt;/em&gt;. Some of the causation in the system is moved from the noisy world of molecules to levels that are less prone to randomness, and are much less influenced by individual parts. This may be required to make biological systems behave in ways that are reliable. Also, Ball points out that simple causal structures would be very vulnerable to attack by pathogens. Spreading some of the causation to higher organisational levels may partially &amp;ldquo;hide&amp;rdquo; it from, say, a virus, which can only &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; molecules.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:causalemergence" title="Jump back to footnote 12 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:designfailures"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;we design the structure so that it can withstand two or three times the worst-case strain&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Overdesigned structures mostly prove to be fairly robust, but &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_failure"&gt;catastrophic failures&lt;/a&gt; do occasionally occur. In 1940, the bridge spanning the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)"&gt;collapsed&lt;/a&gt; in a spectacular way, just thee months after opening. Its design failed to account for oscillations induced by strong winds. More recently, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_accident"&gt;Fukushima Daiichi&lt;/a&gt; nuclear power plant in Japan experienced a meltdown in 2011. While the power plant was designed to withstand heavy earthquakes, a tsunami ended up disabling both the regular cooling system and multiple backup systems. And while serious &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents_and_incidents"&gt;nuclear accidents&lt;/a&gt; are thankfully quite rare, serious &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam_failure"&gt;dam failures&lt;/a&gt; occur fairly regularly. A recent example is the collapse of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derna_dam_collapses"&gt;Derna dams&lt;/a&gt; in Libya last year. The failure of these two dams caused the death of 6,000&amp;ndash;24,000 people, and was the result of heavy rainfall combined with decades of neglected maintenance. Finally, the ongoing incidents and accidents that plague the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings"&gt;Boeing 737 MAX&lt;/a&gt; aircraft show that even in the extremely safety-oriented aviation industry, it is difficult to entirely rule out problems with design and construction.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:designfailures" title="Jump back to footnote 13 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:adaptationfailure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Such systems tend to be robust. [&amp;hellip;] They are able to recover from damage and adapt relatively quickly to new conditions.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Of course adaptation doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee success. There are many examples of individuals dying, species going extinct or communities or ecosystems collapsing as a result of external change. This happens when adaptation is too slow, insufficient or simply not possible. But our immune system shows that adaptation, while not infallible, is very powerful. People whose immune system is compromised in some way are much more vulnerable to pathogens and cancer than people with a healthy immune system. Also the rapid evolution of resistance to pesticides and antibiotics and the speed at which some ecosystems recover from damage show that adaptation should not be underestimated.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:adaptationfailure" title="Jump back to footnote 14 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:overdesign"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;this approach often seems more efficient than overdesigning structures with large safety margins to obtain robustness&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that applying safety factors is a bad thing to do, nor that it&amp;rsquo;s an &amp;ldquo;easy way out&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href="https://blog.saket.dk/reengineering-engineering-8312f857091c"&gt;Engineering is hard&lt;/a&gt;, and applying a safety margin is a very sensible solution. Also note that I chose to use the term overdesign rather than &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering"&gt;overengineering&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, as the latter term is used when we design things in ways that are unnecessarily complicated. Often this is done to increase safety and robustness, but it can sometimes end up making things more fragile. Hence it is often said that &amp;ldquo;less is more&amp;rdquo;, because simpler designs are easier to maintain and troubleshoot. However, neither simple designs nor overengineered ones are necessarily robust in the long term. In later articles I will elaborate on what alternative approaches could look like.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:overdesign" title="Jump back to footnote 15 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article and the next will be a little more technical, we will look at so-called &lt;em&gt;complex systems&lt;/em&gt;. 
I will refer to complexity in future articles, and here I will explain what it is, how we can talk about it and what this all means for scientific understanding, predictability and the possibilities of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Levien van Zon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand our world through stories.
As I wrote in my &lt;a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/beyond-optimists-and-pessimists.html"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, how we see and how we talk about the world matters a lot for the way we understand our surroundings.
This in turn determines which problems we see and how we choose to deal with them.
Stories are much more than just &amp;ldquo;fiction&amp;rdquo;. 
They are internal models of the world that we share with others through the magical medium of language. 
Stories constitute knowledge, both for us as individuals and as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of our day-to-day stories about the world are sloppy and inconsistent.
Therefore much of our modern knowledge derives from science. 
Science aims to tell stories that are more formal and more precise, and that can be examined for their accuracy.
When we&amp;rsquo;re looking for better stories, science is not a bad place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Welcome to the machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since about the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, how we see the world has increasingly been determined by science and technology. 
Especially the concept of &amp;ldquo;the machine&amp;rdquo; has been very important in shaping our thinking as well as our &amp;ldquo;doing&amp;rdquo;.
Many early scientists imagined the world as being similar to a giant machine or clockwork. 
They believed that this &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwork_universe"&gt;clockwork universe&lt;/a&gt; could be fully understood and predicted, once the mechanical laws that govern it had been uncovered.
Enlightenment thinkers often talked about life and human society in terms of machines as well.
For instance, René Descartes famously argued that animals were basically just automatons, biological machines incapable of conscious experience because they lacked a human soul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Industrial Revolution in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries saw the development, study and optimisation of actual human-built machines for an increasing range of tasks. 
This yielded further insights into all kinds of mechanical laws, but also into the role of energy, including the behaviour of heat, electricity, magnetism and light.
Increasingly, nature was seen as something that could and &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be controlled and improved for the benefit of humans.
The forests of Europe were turned into artificial monocultures, optimised for the greatest yield of wood.
In the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the efficiency of factories was maximised according to the &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; principles of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management"&gt;&amp;ldquo;scientific management&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; devised by Frederick Taylor and others.&lt;sup id="fnref:taylorism"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:taylorism"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
Buildings and cities were reimagined as &amp;ldquo;machines for living and working&amp;rdquo; by the architects and designers of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congr%C3%A8s_Internationaux_d%27Architecture_Moderne"&gt;CIAM&lt;/a&gt;, the International Congresses of Modern Architecture.
Much of agriculture was also modelled after the ideal of the factory, which was based on mechanisation, standardisation, scale and control. The aim was to replace the seeming chaos of nature by the efficiency of the factory, in order to increase the production and predictability of food, vegetable oil and fibre. This also resulted in driving down their cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways these collective attempts to understand and improve the world through science and technology were an astounding success.
We understand almost unimaginably more about the universe than we did a few centuries ago, and in many countries the quality and span of human life have greatly increased since then.
But these successes did come at a cost. 
Some of these costs took (and still take) the form of human and non-human suffering, for instance in the former colonies and in industrial production chains, including those of agriculture.
Moreover, while over the past centuries we collectively managed to reduce some problems, we&amp;rsquo;ve created many new ones, or made existing problems worse.
One unintended consequence of mechanisation turned out to be climate change. 
Other examples of the darker sides of &amp;ldquo;progress&amp;rdquo; include biodiversity loss, soil degradation, water shortages, microbial resistance and a pandemic of chronic metabolic diseases (such as diabetes). Also some aspects of social and economic inequality have been created or made worse by technological progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to solve and prevent such problems, it is important to figure out why they occur in the first place.
Many &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; problems are unintended and unexpected side effects of our attempts to improve human wellbeing.
Proponents of technological solutions sometimes argue that these are simply a temporary price that we need to pay for progress.
Further improvements in knowledge and technology will allow us to solve these problems and prevent new ones. 
Is this a realistic expectation, or is it just wishful thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand both the success and the limitations of science and technology, it helps to comprehend a little better how science works, and why it is so effective in answering some questions while it has trouble with others.
As we shall see, many problems actually have to do with our tendency to use human-built machines as a metaphor for how the world and everything in it works.
Machines are built to be optimised and controlled.
But it turns out that most of our world is very unlike a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stories, science and the iron rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all use stories to explain and predict what happens in our surroundings. 
To find out how accurate our explanations and predictions are, our brains constantly compare our expectations with our actual observations and experiences.&lt;sup id="fnref:bayesianbrain"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bayesianbrain"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
In principle, the way in which science works is not much different. 
Scientific theories are basically explanatory and predictive stories, and we constantly compare them with observations to see if they are accurate.
However, there is at least one important thing that sets scientific explanations apart from other types of stories.
Regular stories tend to act as a source of certainty, they provide a framework on which we build our beliefs. 
If we encounter observations that are inconsistent with our explanatory stories, we tend to hold on to our stories and we often ignore or explain away the inconsistent observations.
This also happens in science, of course, simply because scientists are humans. 
But science has the underlying, collective rule that, at least in principle, observations are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; more important than the story used to explain them. 
Philosopher &lt;a href="https://www.strevens.org/scientia/"&gt;Michael Strevens&lt;/a&gt; has called this &amp;ldquo;the iron rule of science&amp;rdquo;.
And this rule is considered sufficiently valuable that (eventually) it tends to win out against human nature:
If the explanation doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the observation, the story isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough and should be modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observations in science often involve active and repeatable manipulations of the world, in the form of experiments.
The language of scientific stories is usually a &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; human language such as English. 
But when possible, the more precise &amp;ldquo;non-natural&amp;rdquo; languages of mathematics and logic are used, as these are less ambiguous and have greater predictive power. 
Whatever the form, the purpose is the same: to describe a part of the world, in an attempt to understand how it works in the most precise way possible. 
This has been especially successful for understanding the non-living physical universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The living world, which includes human societies, has been harder to describe and comprehend. 
Later we will explore some of the reasons for this. 
For now let&amp;rsquo;s just state that the living world is more complex than the non-living world. 
And this has proven somewhat of a challenge for the tools that science has traditionally used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; way to do science is often called &lt;em&gt;reductionism&lt;/em&gt;. 
The reductionist method basically works by taking complicated things apart.
The parts are then manipulated and studied in isolation. 
In this way, a description of more complicated assemblages is built up from descriptions of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works well, as long as the behaviour of an assemblage is mostly determined by the properties of the parts (or by statistical regularities in the interactions of parts).
For instance, finding out the properties of atoms and simple molecules greatly increased our understanding of how more complicated molecules work. 
It also explained much about the properties of gases, fluids and solids, which are formed from large numbers of interacting atoms or molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying parts in a controlled environment allows us to break up the study of complicated things into smaller, more manageable projects.
These simpler studies can also be more easily repeated and checked by others. 
This method is very powerful, and has been extremely successful.
However, it encounters difficulties when there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; interactions between elements. 
When such interactions are significant and are not easy to &amp;ldquo;aggregate&amp;rdquo; into neat statistics, 
it becomes hard to explain a system&amp;rsquo;s behaviour by just studying the interacting parts. 
This is where complexity science can help us, because it is in many respects a &amp;ldquo;science of interactions&amp;rdquo;. 
It is actually not so much a science in itself, but more an add-on to the various sciences. 
It is a toolkit for thinking and talking about complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interacting elements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is a complex system? A &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of elements.
These elements need to be interconnected in ways that produce some collective behaviour. 
If a system is &lt;em&gt;complex&lt;/em&gt;, it usually means that the system has many parts. 
Also, interactions between these parts are important for collective behaviour. 
The word &amp;ldquo;complex&amp;rdquo; comes from Latin, and basically means &amp;ldquo;entwined&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complex system, the parts are hard to separate. 
An example is your body: if you start taking it apart into separate organs or cells, at some point it will stop working well. 
The same applies to most living systems, which is why they are hard to study using the reductionist method. 
You cannot really take them apart without changing the way they work. 
And performing controlled experiments on the interacting parts of a fully functional system isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. 
Reliably repeating such experiments is even harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/complexity-tangle-cropped-small.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should point out that complexity isn&amp;rsquo;t a binary category. 
It&amp;rsquo;s not that something is either simple or complex. 
Complexity is a continuum, some things are more complex than others. 
More complexity can result from more parts or interactions, or because interactions are stronger or more varied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is useful to make a distinction between two kinds of complex systems: &lt;em&gt;complex physical systems&lt;/em&gt; (CPS) and &lt;em&gt;complex adaptive systems&lt;/em&gt; (CAS). 
Complex physical systems have many parts that interact, but the parts themselves &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t change much over time&lt;/em&gt;. 
A relatively simple example would be a pile of sand grains. 
A more complex example is the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complex &lt;em&gt;adaptive&lt;/em&gt; system on the other hand, the &lt;em&gt;parts aren&amp;rsquo;t static&lt;/em&gt;, they can change over time. 
If parts can change, and if they don&amp;rsquo;t all change in the same way, 
individual elements may become different from each other in their properties. 
Complex adaptive systems therefore tend to have &lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt; in their elements. 
And as the name already implies, complex adaptive systems can &lt;em&gt;adapt&lt;/em&gt; to changing conditions. 
All living systems are complex adaptive systems. 
Examples include biological cells, tissues and organs, organisms, ecosystems and human societies and economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More than the sum of its parts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both types of complex systems, interactions between the parts can lead to interesting things. 
One of these is &lt;em&gt;emergence&lt;/em&gt;. This basically means that an assemblage of parts has properties that its parts do not have. 
Think for instance of water, which (in its liquid form) can flow and is wet. 
Water is formed from interacting molecules, but a single water molecule cannot be said to be &amp;ldquo;wet&amp;rdquo;. 
And even though all water molecules are alike, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"&gt;many properties of water&lt;/a&gt; cannot easily be predicted from knowing the properties of a water molecule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water molecules are the building blocks of liquid water, they can also form ice or water vapour.
In general, interacting molecules give rise to gases, fluids or solids. 
We can think of these &amp;ldquo;states of matter&amp;rdquo; as new &lt;em&gt;levels of organisation&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;emerge&lt;/em&gt; from the interactions between molecules. 
A fluid or solid is a &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; in itself, which has its own properties and follows its own peculiar rules. 
Water and ice are clearly very different, even though they are both made up of identical water molecules. 
The different &lt;em&gt;emergent properties&lt;/em&gt; of water, ice and water vapour arise because the same molecules interact in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergence is sometimes presented as exotic, hard to study and almost mystical. 
Yet we are completely surrounded by it, and it determines our daily experience. 
We cannot see molecules interact, so of course we are not used to thinking of the &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; that surround us as emerging from interacting molecules. 
And this is precisely the point: even if we don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about molecules, 
we can interact with things that are made up of molecules, 
because such emergent levels of organisation have their own emergent properties of &amp;ldquo;thingness&amp;rdquo;. 
You can simply sit on a chair without being aware of the molecules of iron, nickel and nitrogen that interact to form crystal microstructures that (hopefully) keep the steel frame of the chair together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; interested in the finer details of things, a medical specialist can study and treat heart problems without knowing all of the processes going on in the human body, or all the molecular components that make up the human heart. 
And an economist can say something about the global market for office chairs without having to study the detailed neural patterns in the brains of all the people that are involved in producing, selling and buying such chairs.
Emergent properties allow us to know things without having to know all of the underlying details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strict laws, shaky laws&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, scientists like Isaac Newton believed that much of the universe was governed by a limited and unchanging set of &amp;ldquo;laws&amp;rdquo;. 
These laws were presumed to be set by the Creator, and humans could &amp;ldquo;discover&amp;rdquo; them through careful experimentation and observation. 
Finding the laws of nature was like unveiling the mind of God.
Over the subsequent centuries, especially physicists proved to be very successful in finding such scientific laws. 
Notably at the subatomic level, many of the rules that govern quantum mechanics seem to be static, fundamental properties of the universe in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the little-known &lt;em&gt;Pauli exclusion principle&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle"&gt;simple rule&lt;/a&gt; that prescribes the structure of the periodic table of elements and many of the properties of matter in our universe. 
A rule like this has a huge effect on the structure of reality, yet is not entirely clear where it comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the successes in physics and chemistry, scientists in other fields also started searching for scientific laws. 
However, the more complex the system that they were studying, the harder it was to find regularities, let alone true &amp;ldquo;natural laws&amp;rdquo;. 
Rules and regularities in the more complex realms of biology, economics and the social sciences bear little resemblance to the &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; predictive laws of physics. 
They are usually more trends than laws: they tend to depend on context, it is often possible to find exceptions and the rules can suddenly change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that even in physics and chemistry, many of the &amp;ldquo;laws of nature&amp;rdquo; are not unchanging properties of the universe. 
Rather, they are emergent properties&lt;sup id="fnref:emergence"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:emergence"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of interacting particles and forces, and they may also depend on context.
As long as the interacting parts (say, molecules) and their surroundings are constant over time, their collective behaviour is often well-defined.&lt;sup id="fnref:epa"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:epa"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
For instance, it is a well-known fact that water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C. But oddly this is almost never the case in the real world.
It is only true for pure water under a standard pressure of 1 atmosphere, and under fairly slow heating or cooling.
Any deviation from standard pressure (for instance with altitude) or anything that is dissolved into water (for instance salt) will shift the boiling and freezing points to higher or lower temperatures. 
But at least water molecules are all the same, so the effects of such external influences are more or less predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However as I already mentioned, discovering the behavioural rules of a system becomes much more difficult if the interacting parts &lt;em&gt;aren&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; constant over time. 
In complex adaptive systems, &amp;ldquo;natural laws&amp;rdquo; at the level of the system aren&amp;rsquo;t fixed, they can change over time as the interacting parts change. 
For example, the rules that seem to govern the economy depend on the structure of the economy, and on the usual, average behaviour of people. 
If these things change, so sometimes do the rules.
Even worse, a seemingly small change in the underlying parts or interactions can occasionally lead to dramatically different system rules and behaviours. 
Minor interaction details can therefore matter a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any given study you can only look at a limited set of conditions and interactions. 
Therefore it is often very cumbersome to figure out what&amp;rsquo;s going on in a complex adaptive system. 
It can become almost impossible to predict what will happen if conditions change. 
We can still learn and know things about complex systems, even if their parts are not all identical and constant. 
But it requires a lot of work, and our ability to make generalised statements and predictions is rather limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Predictability problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point is worth emphasising. The behaviour of complex systems usually cannot be predicted very far into the future, even in the unlikely case that all elements and their interactions are known. 
This is not just because elements and interactions may sometimes change. 
The problem also exists in many complex physical systems, in which the parts themselves do not change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there are many strong interactions, every element can end up influencing many other elements, including itself. 
And because interactions take time and this time may vary, it may become impossible to predict the precise order in which interactions take place. 
This creates an uncertainty about the outcome of interactions, which can rapidly get worse with time.&lt;sup id="fnref:chaos"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:chaos"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
This is the main reason why we cannot predict the weather with good accuracy more than a few days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it gets worse. We saw that emergent properties allow us to know about and interact with things without having to know all of the underlying details. 
But the inverse isn&amp;rsquo;t true. 
Even if we would have full knowledge about &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; details of physics and chemistry (which currently isn&amp;rsquo;t the case), this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily help us to explain and predict what happens at a higher, emergent level of organisation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example from a complex social system: What happens in, say, regional politics cannot really be reduced to physics and chemistry, or even to neuroscience.&lt;sup id="fnref:reductionism"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:reductionism"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
It depends mostly on interactions between, in this case, politicians and other groups in a society. 
It also depends on interactions with other systems (for instance, economies) and other levels of organisation (like
national and international politics and geopolitical power relations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/beyond-optimists-and-pessimists.html"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;,
I talked about various ways of seeing the world in relation to sustainability. 
The ecomodernist worldview tends to emphasise the potential for large-scale technological solutions to sustainability problems, based on existing institutions and economic growth.
Ecomodernists strongly believe in the power of science and engineering.
In contrast, the antimodernist or neo-romantic worldview tends to promote smaller-scale solutions with a bigger role for nature and local communities. Neo-romantics often have much less confidence in the explanatory abilities of science, and they tend to distrust large-scale application of industrial approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neo-romantics often point out the fact that we live in a world that is dominated by complex systems. 
This has consequences for how much we can rely on large-scale control and on stable economic growth. 
Especially industrial approaches require conditions that are more or less stable, uniform and predictable. As we have seen, predictability is inherently limited in a complex world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Promises of &amp;ldquo;simplexity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a hope that complexity science would allow us to eventually predict and control many complex systems.
Researchers observed that complex behaviour can sometimes arise from very simple interaction rules. 
There are many examples of this in nature, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG-QZOTc5_Q"&gt;foraging of ants&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://animals.howstuffworks.com/birds/starling-murmurations.htm"&gt;flocking of starlings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expectation was that we would be able to uncover simple rules to explain the behaviour of many other complex systems, including human societies. 
Indeed, there has been much progress in our understanding. 
But the more we learn, the more it seems that the potential for prediction and generalisation is limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of a specific system can matter a lot. 
Even if there are simple rules underlying its behaviour, we still have to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; those rules for every different system. 
And if conditions change, the rules can change as well and our predictions may no longer work.
Yet we would overstate the problem if we conclude that the world is too complex for us to understand, or that control is utterly impossible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much depends on what our goals and expectations are.
The &amp;ldquo;industrial approach&amp;rdquo; to solving problems usually depends on maximising predictability and control.
As we have seen, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well in systems that are more complex.
The many interactions that occur in a complex system put hard limits on predictability.
Often the response has been to simplify complex systems. 
Removing parts and interactions and reducing diversity makes a system more predictable, and easier to control and optimise.
This is for instance the approach that industrial agriculture has taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that in complex &lt;em&gt;adaptive&lt;/em&gt; systems, the parts have usually adapted &lt;em&gt;to each other&lt;/em&gt;.
If you remove parts and interactions, many such adaptations cease to function well, and problems begin to occur.
We often see this happen if we reduce the diversity of a natural system, or of a semi-natural system such as agriculture. An example of this is the occurrence of pests in agriculture. Pests are generally made worse by removal of natural predators or competitors that help keep down their numbers. Another example is the rapid decline of pollinating insects. Both problems are partially caused by decrease of diversity through pesticide use and the &amp;ldquo;optimisation&amp;rdquo; of agricultural landscapes for maximum yield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Health despite uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional problem is that complex systems are hard to study, as we&amp;rsquo;ve already seen.
The scientific method relies to a large extent on reductionism.
If we cannot take a system apart and study its parts under controlled conditions, it becomes hard to understand how things work and what exactly is going on.
A good example of this is human health.
After more than a century of intense collective research effort, we know quite a lot about the various parts of the human body.
Yet we still don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand how some of its most basic control mechanisms operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity involved in something like the immune system or the body&amp;rsquo;s energy regulation is enormous.
Every part seems connected to everything else, and it is often very hard to distinguish cause from effect.
We are able to replace some mechanical parts when they are broken, which in itself is very impressive.&lt;sup id="fnref:chemicalparts"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:chemicalparts"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
But when it comes to the major regulatory mechanisms that maintain our health, we are mostly unable to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; problems when they occur.
We simply do not understand the body well enough, and the exact cause of many problems still remains elusive.
It is at least clear that our body is very unlike a machine. We cannot simply shut it down, locate and replace the broken part and start it back up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this does not mean that we cannot improve our health or reduce the effects of disease.
We may not be able to fully control or understand the human body, but we are often quite capable of nudging it towards a more healthy state. 
And even if we can&amp;rsquo;t, we can at least slow down damage and reduce its effects.
Even better, we can reduce the risks of disease occurring in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above does not just apply to the human body, but to many other complex systems as well.
We may not be able to fully control or fix them, but we can try to understand them &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; while keeping in mind that we do not know all relevant details.
Partial understanding may already allow us to prevent problems.
And when problems do occur, we can often steer a system towards a healthier state, step by step through careful observation and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We certainly shouldn&amp;rsquo;t ignore complexity, but we also shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be overly afraid of it. 
The living world has always been complex, and in recent years we have learned a lot about the ways in which living systems don&amp;rsquo;t just deal with complexity and unpredictability, but in some ways even use it to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strevens, Michael. &lt;em&gt;The Knowledge Machine: How Irrationality Created Modern Science&lt;/em&gt;. W.W. Norton, 2020.   &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.strevens.org/scientia"&gt;https://www.strevens.org/scientia&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Philosopher Michael Strevens makes the argument that science is special 
mostly due to what he calls its &amp;ldquo;iron rule&amp;rdquo;: Empirical observations
always have precedence over theoretical or philosophical explanations. 
Moreover, as an institution, science sets strict rules on acceptable behaviour 
and the things that may or may not be discussed in its official communication channels. 
This creates a buffer between public scientific work (which is published in journals)
and private beliefs (which may be discussed and published elsewhere). 
This explains why for instance Isaac Newton could both be one of the great
empirical scientists, and at the same time a highly religious alchemist, who believed in mystical forces.
Some of this is also discussed in the Jim Rutt Show podcast, &lt;a href="https://www.jimruttshow.com/michael-strevens/"&gt;episode 106&lt;/a&gt;,
and in Strevens&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href="https://www.strevens.org/scientia/inextremis.shtml"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Science Is Irrational—and a Good Thing, Too&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This book by Mitchell Waldrop is what got me (and many others)
interested in complexity science. Since its publication, it has been
criticised for its narrow focus on the &lt;a href="https://www.santafe.edu/"&gt;Santa Fe Institute&lt;/a&gt; and
its portrayal of complexity researchers as young
rebels fighting against a conservative scientific establishment clinging
on to reductionism (which makes for a good story but is not entirely accurate). 
Also, the book is now three decades old, and some of its
hopes for complexity science seem a little optimistic with current-day knowledge.
Especially the life sciences have progressed a lot since the early 1990s in their understanding of complex living systems, as is described for instance by Philip Ball in his book &lt;a href="https://how-life-works.philipball.co.uk"&gt;How Life Works&lt;/a&gt;, which is listed below. 
Yet despite such critical notes, &lt;em&gt;Complexity&lt;/em&gt; still provides an attractive and readable introduction to many aspects of complex adaptive systems.&lt;/p&gt;

A useful if somewhat technical introduction by John Holland, one of the founders of complexity science. Holland makes the distinction between complex physical systems (CPS) and complex adaptive systems (CAS). This to me was a revelation because it makes it much easier to see the limitations of &amp;ldquo;particle based&amp;rdquo; analyses and descriptions that were adapted from physics. These often apply quite well to CPS (or approximations thereof), but are often not a good description of CAS because they cannot deal well with adaptation and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

In the introduction chapter of this book, science writer Philip Ball offers a good introduction to complexity and its relevance to social systems. The rest of the book discusses examples of (moderately) complex social phenomena that have so far been studied relatively well: the behaviour of traffic and crowds, effects of contagion in how social norms get established, the spread of crime and disease, problems of social cooperation and the dynamics of social networks, financial systems, cities and military conflicts. The book ends with an overview of the ambitious 2013 &lt;a href="https://coss.ethz.ch/research/pastprojects/futurict.html"&gt;FuturICT&lt;/a&gt; project, which promised better management of complex social problems through application of big data and complexity science, and which was followed up in 2017 by &lt;a href="https://coss.ethz.ch/research/pastprojects/FuturICT20.html"&gt;FuturICT 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, the official websites of both projects no longer exist. While ambitious tech-driven projects like these are certainly interesting, one does start to wonder about their ability to offer a significant and robust contribution to future solutions. There may have been valuable results, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say. Clearly, the way in which such projects are funded for a limited period already makes it hard to maintain a long-term website describing project outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

The work of &lt;a href="https://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~cgershensong/"&gt;Carlos Gershenson&lt;/a&gt; offers several important insights on how the interactions in complex systems limit their predictability, and how we can deal with this. The two articles above give an accessible overview of these issues. Gershenson discusses problems with reductionism in cases where relevant nonlinear interactions add emergent information to the system that cannot be derived from just knowing the parts. This often leads to &lt;em&gt;computational irreducibility&lt;/em&gt;: the only way to determine the future state of a system is to run it. Due to their inherent unpredictability, the perfect control of complex, open systems is utopic. Therefore systems should be made to be robust and adaptive. Engineered systems usually are neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott, James C. &lt;em&gt;Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed&lt;/em&gt;. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998.   &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300246759/seeing-like-a-state/"&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300246759/seeing-like-a-state/&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
In this insightful work, political scientist and anthropologist James C. Scott examines the history of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_modernism"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Modernism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a worldview that reached its peak in the 1950s and 1960s and in which nature and tradition were considered messy, outdated and inefficient. Instead, the social and natural world should be reordered according to &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; modern principles of science, technology, geometry and centralised planning. Scott shows how &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; foresters of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century and the modernist states of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century simplified the social and natural systems they presided over. In doing so, they destroyed much of the complex ecological and social fabric required for systems to function well.   &lt;br&gt;
One of the final chapters is on agriculture. Scott shows that &amp;ldquo;all agriculture is local&amp;rdquo;, while the results from agricultural research are always necessarily generalised, because no research method can take into account the near infinite number of possible local variations. The experience and skill of farmers is therefore required to translate and adapt generic results and instructions to actual local conditions. In effect, the farmer himself needs to be a researcher and experimenter as well. This is a far cry from the idea that agriculture can be practised by unskilled industrial workers applying an &amp;ldquo;optimal&amp;rdquo; one-size-fits-all recipe developed by experts.&lt;/p&gt;

In this &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/read/ted-books/ted-books-library/the-laws-of-medicine"&gt;short book&lt;/a&gt;, medical researcher, doctor and science writer &lt;a href="https://siddharthamukherjee.com"&gt;Siddhartha Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; argues that the practice of medial science differs from the way we usually think about science. We are used to thinking of science as providing certainty, often in the form of scientific laws. However, medical science and the practice of medicine mostly have to deal with &lt;em&gt;uncertainty&lt;/em&gt;, because there is so much about the human body that we &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; yet know. However we cannot give up in the face of such fundamental ignorance, because doctors still have to treat patients and keep them alive. Rather than &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; scientific laws, Mukherjee argues that medicine has effective methods for dealing with uncertainty, imprecision, and incompleteness. And much of this depends on the skill and experience of medical practitioners, precisely because text book knowledge is incomplete and each patient is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball, Philip. &lt;em&gt;How Life Works: A User&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the New Biology&lt;/em&gt;. University of Chicago Press, 2023.    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://how-life-works.philipball.co.uk"&gt;https://how-life-works.philipball.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
To understand things we don&amp;rsquo;t know, we necessarily think of them in terms that we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; familiar with. One of the underlying themes of this fascinating book on how life works, is that we tend to think of living systems using metaphors from technology. Thus we think of cells as factories and we think of proteins as machines. We think of genes as computer software and we think of the brain as a computer. 
However, living systems mostly function &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; differently from human-built machines. The problem is that we tend to forget that we are using metaphors, and that they then start to limit our thinking in serious ways. And while science has a method for testing theories, it has no good method for uprooting inappropriate metaphors. 
Ball proposes that the metaphors we use for understanding living systems should mostly come from living systems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the efficiency of factories was maximised according to the &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; principles of &amp;ldquo;scientific management&amp;rdquo; devised by Frederick Taylor and others.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
The ideas of Taylor and his followers are still known as &lt;em&gt;Taylorism&lt;/em&gt;, and were influential far beyond their original context of factory organisation. Many politicians, policy makers and designers saw scientific management as the key to designing a more rational and efficient society. The essay &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/002200947000500202"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between Taylorism and Technocracy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Charles S. Maier (1970) discusses some of the main influences of Taylorism on European policies, politics and ideas in the decades leading up to the Second World War.

&lt;li id="fn:bayesianbrain"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To find out how accurate our explanations and predictions are, our brains constantly compare our expectations with our actual observations and experiences.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
In its most concrete form, this is known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function"&gt;Bayesian Brain&lt;/a&gt; Theory. A very readable account of the underlying ideas and their consequences is given by neuroscientist Anil Seth in his book &lt;a href="https://www.anilseth.com/being-you/"&gt;Being You: A New Science of Consciousness&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:bayesianbrain" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:emergence"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those familiar with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"&gt;emergence&lt;/a&gt; may note that I use quite a broad definition of the concept here, which is certainly not universally used or accepted. While the idea may be very useful, emergence can also be a tricky and slippery concept once you try to get into the details&amp;mdash;something which I shall not do here.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:emergence" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:epa"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As long as the interacting parts (say, molecules) and their surroundings are constant over time, their collective behaviour is often well-defined.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Why the derivation of macroscopic descriptions and laws from the microscopic behaviour of dynamically interacting parts is possible, is described in &lt;a href="https://www.strevens.org/chaos/chaos_paper.shtml"&gt;Strevens (2005)&lt;/a&gt;. It works by using probability theory to derive average group outcomes from individual behaviour plus interactions. It is actually quite surprising that this works as well as it does. This approach mostly works well in cases where there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; identical parts, and strong interactions are relatively rare. It has even been applied to &lt;em&gt;adaptive&lt;/em&gt; systems, for instance in population ecology and genetics. This does however require us to treat adaptive systems as if they are physical systems: the parts are assumed to be mostly identical and not to change much over time.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:epa" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:chaos"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because interactions take time and this time may vary, it becomes impossible to predict the precise order in which interactions take place. This creates an uncertainty about the outcome of interactions, which can rapidly get worse with time.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
Such unpredictability is often referred to as &lt;em&gt;chaos&lt;/em&gt;, but chaos is a subtly different phenomenon that does not strictly require complexity. See &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.nlin/0402023"&gt;Gershenson &amp;amp; Heylighen (2004)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1105.2827"&gt;Gershenson (2013)&lt;/a&gt; for a somewhat more detailed description of the distinction between deterministic chaos (i.e. sensitive dependence on initial conditions due to positive feedback) and the effect of variable time delays in complex interaction networks. Such complex networks have many possible interaction paths that may result in amplifying or attenuating feedback. If interaction times are not roughly constant, it is impossible to know beforehand which paths get activated in which order, and thus what the net outcome of interactions will be. Of course deterministic chaos and random noise may further compound the difficulties in predicting the behaviour of complex systems. However if there are large numbers of &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; parts, strong interactions are relatively rare and the behaviour of parts is fairly consistent, variations tend to average out and system behaviour becomes much more predictable, as described in &lt;a href="https://www.strevens.org/chaos/chaos_paper.shtml"&gt;Strevens (2005)&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:chaos" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:reductionism"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What happens in, say, regional politics cannot really be reduced to physics and chemistry, or even to neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
It is a long-standing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; whether this is possible &lt;em&gt;in principle&lt;/em&gt;. But even if it would be, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible in practice, so such discussions need not concern us here. There is however evidence that implementing aspects of human decision making into computer simulations can reproduce some collective social phenomena, including perhaps some voting behaviour. See for instance the work of &lt;a href="https://www.jimruttshow.com/joshua-epstein/"&gt;Joshua M. Epstein&lt;/a&gt;. While such simulations may contribute to our mechanistic understanding of system dynamics, they have little predictive power under real-world conditions, which are much too complex to simulate.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:reductionism" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:chemicalparts"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are able to replace some mechanical parts when they are broken, which in itself is very impressive.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
We are even able to replace some body parts involved in chemical or electrical control or perception. Usually however these are not full replacements: they offer a simplified version of the original biological functions. Think of pacemakers, insulin pumps, bionic eyes and robotic prosthetic limbs and hands.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:chemicalparts" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Levien van Zon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a lover of books, I enjoy going into bookshops and libraries. I love to check out
new releases on all kinds of subjects. But when it comes to one of my
main interests, sustainability, I am often disappointed by the writings on offer. 
There are many excellent and important books on all aspects of sustainability. 
Yet, something always feels wrong. It feels as if we&amp;rsquo;re a bit stuck. 
Half of the stories I see seem too optimistic, and the other half too pessimistic. 
If we are moving forward at all, it&amp;rsquo;s only very haltingly, at least when it comes to
important collective insights. The dominant stories on how humanity
should proceed all seem to be somewhat broken. And more crucially, they
contradict each other in important ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modernists, romantics and pessimists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exists quite a large diversity in thinking and writing on
sustainability. Attempts at categorisation are often somewhat
arbitrary. Nonetheless, let&amp;rsquo;s look at one particular way of
categorising some of the major points of view on sustainability. One
important way of thinking treats sustainability as mostly a set of
technical or behavioural problems. In this view, technology X or Y or
certain small changes in our behaviour will fix everything. We&amp;rsquo;ll call this
the &amp;ldquo;ecomodernist&amp;rdquo; point of view. Then there are ideas on how
everything is connected and on how modernity has messed things up. These
usually suggest that we should put more trust in nature and in small
communities, and less in technology and in human institutions. We can
think of this as the &amp;ldquo;antimodernist&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;neo-romantic&amp;rdquo; point of
view. Finally, there are quite a few stories on how we&amp;rsquo;re all doomed
because of climate change, and on how only drastic and immediate action
can keep humanity from going extinct soon. We&amp;rsquo;ll call this
&amp;ldquo;ecopessimism&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually we choose a point of view based on our existing beliefs and our
preferences. If you want to believe that technology can solve most of
our problems, you will probably prefer an &amp;ldquo;ecomodernist&amp;rdquo; view.
Probably you will also believe additional things, which are connected to
this. For instance: &amp;ldquo;progress&amp;rdquo; is a very powerful idea, and economic
growth can help stabilise societies and drive innovation, as long as the
negative side effects of economic activity can be kept in check. There
is probably some merit to these ideas. However, you may also be overly
optimistic about the future and the things that technology can do. And
you may underestimate the myriad ways in which the complexities of the
real world may sabotage even the best-laid plans and the most advanced
technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you deem nature to be superior to anything that we
humans tend to come up with, you will probably be partial to
&amp;ldquo;neo-romanticism&amp;rdquo;. You may share my opinion that nature and
long-standing cultural traditions aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;backward&amp;rdquo;. Rather, looking
at natural evolution and traditional culture can be very useful, as this
may provide us with robust, time-tested solutions to some of our modern
problems. However, you may also presume that everything that is natural
tends to be &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;. And even if you don&amp;rsquo;t, you may assign agency and
purpose to nature in ways that don&amp;rsquo;t match our current understanding of
how natural processes operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you believe that humankind is basically digging its own
grave, you will probably tend toward &amp;ldquo;ecopessimism&amp;rdquo;. You will
recognise that infinite growth is impossible given finite resources,
that technology tends to have negative side effects and that both of
these can eventually destabilise societies. Indeed, climate change
poses a serious challenge to both human and natural systems.
But focusing &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; on fears of collapse is probably unhelpful. 
You may underestimate the resilience of both natural and social systems, and
their capacity to adapt when put under pressure. Moreover you will
likely experience a constant feeling of urgency, and many of your
expectations for the future will be built on fear. This may lead to
anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People like Bill Gates, as well as many economists, engineers,
politicians and CEOs tend towards the ecomodernist perspective, claiming
that the combination of technology and &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; economic growth is the
way forward. People who put more trust in nature, community or
spirituality often lean towards neo-romanticism. They propose that a
sustainable future requires a &amp;ldquo;holistic&amp;rdquo; worldview, and local,
small-scale and often low-tech solutions. This view is common in
various &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; subcultures. It is also found in the &amp;ldquo;postmodern&amp;rdquo;
discourse that is currently prevalent in much of the arts and humanities. 
And an example of ecopessimism can be found in climate activist movements 
such as Extinction Rebellion, that push for drastic reduction 
of greenhouse gas emissions now, to prevent complete climate collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wizard, prophet or both?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m oversimplifying. It is true that we tend to subscribe to viewpoints
that match our existing beliefs and preferences. We also listen more
favourably to ideas and opinions that are common in the social groups
that we belong to. But things aren&amp;rsquo;t as rigid as they seem. Humans are
very good at believing multiple things at the same time, even if these
are not mutually consistent. We&amp;rsquo;re able to switch between these various
viewpoints and beliefs, sometimes very rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles C. Mann, in his excellent book &lt;em&gt;The Wizard and The Prophet&lt;/em&gt;,
writes that he tends to oscillate between seeing things from two
contradictory perspectives. One he calls the &lt;em&gt;wizard&lt;/em&gt; perspective, based
on the belief that the way forward is in growth and technological fixes.
The other is the &lt;em&gt;prophet&lt;/em&gt; perspective, grounded in the conviction that we need
to reduce our consumption and our population growth. One day, his views
are those of the wizard, another day he feels more like a prophet, and
some days he simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t know. This is probably true for many of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The importance of stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course many more and more nuanced views on sustainability
than just the extremes of &lt;em&gt;wizards&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;prophets&lt;/em&gt;, or of ecomodernist,
neo-romantic or ecopessimist. I use these as examples to illustrate a
point: stories are important. They are lenses through which we see the 
world, and they also determine how we act in it. 
All stories, however, simplify things, and this can end up blinding us 
to certain aspects of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, there exists a diversity of viewpoints and explanatory
stories, within a society and even in our heads. This diversity is
beneficial in many ways, but it can also confuse us, and it can sabotage or
slow down effective action. It can even interfere with the
identification of what the important problems are that need solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;img src="//sustainsubstance.org/images/no-more-reality-grey-red-150dpi.jpg" style="width: 50%; height: auto; border: 0px;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When talking about stories, we usually think of &lt;em&gt;fiction&lt;/em&gt;, but this is
not what I mean here. Stories, in a broader sense, are models of the world
that are based on language (including visual and other non-linguistic
languages). What we call fiction is just one example of storytelling.
Fictional stories are important, they are about aspects of the world
that interest or entertain us. A &lt;em&gt;nonfiction&lt;/em&gt; story is an attempt to
describe a part of the world. The attempt doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily yield an
&lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt; description, though. While we see &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the lenses of 
stories, we rarely examine the lenses themselves, to question their 
assumptions and their limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories can be seen as models of the world, but they are not merely
descriptive. Most stories, whether fiction or nonfiction, are also
normative. They don&amp;rsquo;t just portray the world as it is, they also show
how we think it should be. Our stories are intimately tied up with our
values, the things that we find important. They are also tied up with
our goals, the things that we strive for. Stories help determine how we
look at the world and how we talk about it. Furthermore they help to
determine how we act in it and how we think others should act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Story clashes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories can describe different aspects of the world at different levels.
For instance, some stories are mostly functional, while other ones are more
emotional. Some try to explain the world as it is, while others are more
about articulating or reinforcing values, or about finding meaning.
These different stories can coexist in our heads and are not always
consistent with each other. In fact they rarely are. And while all
stories simplify, often they simplify too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For almost as long as I remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by what we now
call sustainability. As a young boy in the 1980s I worried over the
uncertain future facing panda bears, rhinos and elephants. I saw how
organisations such as Greenpeace directed our attention to industrial
pollution. I witnessed in wonder how some governments thought it a good
idea to dump nuclear waste into the ocean. I was a teenager during the
optimistic 1990s, when the Cold War had ended, Western economies were
doing well and some people predicted &amp;ldquo;the end of history&amp;rdquo;. All
humanity&amp;rsquo;s problems were to be speedily resolved by the free market. As
I studied Environmental Science, &amp;ldquo;the environment&amp;rdquo; was rapidly going
out of fashion. It seemed, indeed, that most environmental problems had
been reduced to technical issues, to be solved by better technology and
better management. At the opening of the new millennium, I became
fascinated by the upcoming science of complex systems. People around me
started paying more attention to climate change, with many arguing that
there was, in fact, no such thing. While I was working on my Master&amp;rsquo;s
degree in Theoretical Biology, worries about the future resurfaced.
Increasingly people were talking about sustainability and climate. And
as I write this, climate change is rapidly becoming a reality for many.
Sustainability has grown from a fringe interest of activists and
academics to one of the major issues discussed in politics and society
at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, most books, articles and talks on sustainability talk about &amp;ldquo;the
environment&amp;rdquo; as something out there. Something that needs to be fixed,
protected or saved in one way or the other. Discussions about
sustainability often seem either technical or superficial, or both. For
example, we talk about decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth.
We pretend that the &amp;ldquo;planet will be saved&amp;rdquo; by reducing plastic
packaging or electricity use. We talk about sustainability as &amp;ldquo;meeting
the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs&amp;rdquo;. Oddly, we often fail to define
what exactly the most relevant needs of the present are, or the needs of
future generations, or the needs of other, non-human life forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly technical aspects to sustainability but it isn&amp;rsquo;t
primarily a technical problem. It&amp;rsquo;s an issue of values that touches at
the core of what it is to be human. We humans are probably the only
species on this planet that is able to make rational plans quite far
into the future. What do we want, as individuals, as families, as
communities, as societies, as a species, in the short term and in the
long term? Do we wish to spend our short lives accumulating as much as
possible at the expense of others? Most of us would probably answer this
with no. Do we want our species, our societies to grow exponentially
until resources run out and then crash, only to start growing again in
some kind of &amp;ldquo;boom and bust&amp;rdquo; pattern? Probably not. If we do not want
this future, why do many of our stories and our ideals not reflect our
wishes? One of our most common ideals is still to get rich, so we can
stop working and live comfortably. And our most common collective goal
is still to sustain economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about sustainability issues is that they will
always disappear, eventually. Unsustainable behaviour, by definition,
cannot last forever. We either fix it voluntarily, or it is forced to
stop at some point. The difficult question is: what will the collapse of
unsustainable behaviour take with it? How much damage are we willing to
incur? How do we recognise truly unsustainable behaviour before serious
damage is done? And are we willing and able to reduce the perceived
&amp;ldquo;needs&amp;rdquo; of the present, in order to allow for the needs of future
generations, or those of non-human species?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is sustainability anyway?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, it is not so straightforward to say what &amp;ldquo;sustainability&amp;rdquo; should be
about. It is perhaps easier to state what sustainability &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt;. The
point of sustainability isn&amp;rsquo;t to continue what we are doing at the
moment. It simply isn&amp;rsquo;t realistically possible to keep our current
resource-intensive societies running indefinitely, not even if we&amp;rsquo;d
manage to drastically reduce our use of resources and our emission of
waste products. And even if it were possible to continue current
practices, the question is whether we should want to. The current global
economic system isn&amp;rsquo;t very good at providing everyone with their
necessities to lead a happy, healthy and stress-free life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainability also isn&amp;rsquo;t about preventing human extinction. Even if
our most dire predictions will come true, we&amp;rsquo;d most likely still
survive as a species. While it is certainly possible that some calamity
will drastically reduce the human population, humans have so far proven
to be quite a resilient bunch. Moreover, &amp;ldquo;not going extinct&amp;rdquo; is
setting the bar a little low, in my opinion. One would hope that we can
do better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maintaining and improving wellbeing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if our long-term goal isn&amp;rsquo;t the continuation of current economies
and the preservation of our species, what could we be aiming for
instead? My proposal is to aim for continuing and improving the
&lt;em&gt;wellbeing&lt;/em&gt; of both humans and other life-forms. Wellbeing may seem like
a vague concept, not much better than &amp;ldquo;needs&amp;rdquo;. But as I will try to
show in this article series, the concept of wellbeing is a lot more
concrete than &amp;ldquo;needs&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo;. Wellbeing is connected to
physical and mental health. It is, to some extent, the absence of
prolonged physical and mental stress. In a highly social species such as
humans, it is also connected to a healthy social environment, as well as
to our possibilities for self-realisation. Unfortunately we tend to
confuse wellbeing with things like comfort, freedom of choice and
&amp;ldquo;welfare&amp;rdquo; or individual wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should probably also aim to stabilise our societies. We might not
need to &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; the planet, but for our own sake we should stop
destroying or degrading our own life-support systems and the things in
the world that give us pleasure (which includes much of nature).
Probably few people would disagree with this goal. However, social
dynamics are rarely guided by rational thinking or common sense. Large
and complex societies have their own peculiar dynamics, which are
difficult to steer and may not always favour long-term stability. Still,
there is much room for improvement. And as we shall see, telling &lt;em&gt;better
stories&lt;/em&gt; can play a role in this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stories as simplifying models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted before, stories shape the way we see and understand the world. They
are about cause and effect and about what is important.
Essentially, stories are simple toy-models of the world, or rather of
parts of the world. We build these models in our heads, and we can share
them with others, which is a kind of human superpower. Stories help us
to simplify the world, which is useful because our brains can only
handle so much complexity. Stories give us a sense of identity and
purpose and they can help us set priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to prefer simple stories over complicated stories, because
simple stories make our lives easier. They can specify which categories
of things are &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo;. This then helps us seek or avoid such
good and bad things. Examples of &amp;ldquo;good vs. bad&amp;rdquo; stories are not hard
to find. They clearly stand out in wartime propaganda, and in most
organised religions. But they are also common in other areas of daily
life, for instance in political views (e.g. &amp;ldquo;wokes&amp;rdquo; vs. moral
conservatives), dietary trends (ketogenic diets, veganism, paleo diets)
or economics (free markets vs. strong governments). Also the ways in
which we think about sustainability are full of &amp;ldquo;the bad&amp;rdquo; (flying,
eating meat) and &amp;ldquo;the good&amp;rdquo; (solar energy, buying local, organic
produce, travelling by train). Thinking in terms of good and bad is
attractive, it provides a shorthand for moral assessments. &lt;em&gt;Good
vs. bad&lt;/em&gt; stories also provide a strong sense of shared values that link
us to our social groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple stories provide a feeling of certainty, and we much prefer
certainty over uncertainty and doubt. In fact, simplifying stories are
so important to us that we will defend them when they are challenged.
When we are confronted with evidence that contradicts our main
explanatory stories, we often choose to ignore it. Rather than question
our internal story, we actively go in search of evidence that will
support it, and we try to convince others that our stories are somehow
more &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; than theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories can be big or small, they can construct utopian ideals for a
whole society or describe individuals recycling some of their waste.
Still, many stories share similarities in structure. One well-known
story arc is the &lt;em&gt;Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey.&lt;/em&gt; One or more heroes must face and
overcome difficulties in order to help their people or loved ones. The
majority of Hollywood movies follow this story arc. All of us also
construct these types of stories in our heads, all the time. Most of us
want our lives to matter. We generally strive to be the hero of our own life
stories, working toward some future goal. We want to be remembered when
we are gone. If our internal story lines and goals become so separated
from reality that we can no longer ignore the growing gap, we can become
depressed, until we manage to define new goals or develop a new
story line to give our lives renewed direction and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shared stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a group we construct collective stories to give direction to our
societies. One extreme example is the utopian story of Communism, which
promised to end inequality by getting rid of private property
altogether. A somewhat less extreme example can be found in the SDGs,
the Sustainable Development Goals. These broadly aim to increase
well-being for all humans and protect the lives of non-human species. In
fact, the concept of &amp;ldquo;development&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;progress&amp;rdquo; is in itself a
shared story, and a fairly useful one, although it is not without
problems. We will examine these problems later, in a separate article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said before, all stories are simplifications. This in itself isn&amp;rsquo;t
a problem. It can become a problem, however, when we forget or ignore
the fact that our stories are simplifications. The story of Communism
was a simplification. Communist utopia never became a reality and would
probably never come. In fact, many communist leaders were perfectly
aware of this. Yet they stuck to the story, because it was useful. It
provided a common goal, at least in theory. It also provided a shared
identity which, for a while at least, kept communist and socialist
societies together. The story of Capitalism is a similar kind of
simplification. In his well-known book &lt;em&gt;Sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, the author and
historian Yuval Noah Harari calls such stories &amp;ldquo;shared fictions&amp;rdquo;. In
his view, ideologies such as Communism and Capitalism are shared
fictions, as are all religions, and even things such as &amp;ldquo;money&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the
government&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the law&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the economy&amp;rdquo;. Shared fictions are
concepts and stories that we collectively believe in and that therefore,
through our collective actions, have real power in the world. Shared
fictions can also lose their power if we stop believing in them, as when
currencies collapse again and again throughout history. However, as long
as they persist, shared fictions are very powerful tools to coordinate
collective action within human societies. Humans are storytelling
animals, it is our superpower. It is also the cause of much suffering
and many problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared stories are very hard to change, because they are distributed
over a great many minds. Moreover, our shared stories are tied up with
our shared identities. This is important for binding people together
within a society. But it can also cause us to drift apart, because we
contrast our identities with &amp;ldquo;others&amp;rdquo; outside the social groups we
identify with. This can result in polarisation between groups in a
society, which in the best case can sabotage collective coordinated
action required to solve large-scale problems. In the worst case it can
lead to extreme violence between &amp;ldquo;tribes&amp;rdquo; of people who base their
identity on different stories, different ways of viewing the world and
their place in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blind spots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if our collective stories don&amp;rsquo;t lead to polarisation or violence,
they can be problematic. They help us to understand and navigate the
world, but they also blind us to the parts of the world that do not fit
the story line. Our stories lead us to collectively focus on certain
problems and connected kinds of solutions. Sometimes this is
counterproductive, especially if we try to apply simple stories to
situations that are complex, and even more so if we do this on a large
scale. An example is the relentless focus on &amp;ldquo;efficiency&amp;rdquo;, which has
come to dominate much of our global thinking, especially in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;
century. Thinking in terms of efficiency can be useful, and has proven
very powerful in shaping the modern world. But making a system more
efficient tends to reduce its diversity and its resilience, which almost
always causes problems in the long run. An obvious case in point is the
production of food through large-scale monocultures. This is very
efficient, at least in terms of product yield per hectare or acre. But
obtaining such high yields generally requires large-scale application of
fuel, fertiliser, irrigation water and pesticides. Moreover, many of the
techniques of modern agriculture have negative effects on the quality of
agricultural soils. Consequently, yields have become increasingly
sensitive to shortages of water and fertiliser, and to high fuel prices,
bad weather and the appearance of new pests. Continuing this trend is
unlikely to achieve long-term sustainability. Yet there is a tendency in
&amp;ldquo;ecomodernist&amp;rdquo; stories to emphasise the need for further increase in
agricultural efficiency in order to &amp;ldquo;feed the world&amp;rdquo; without expanding
agricultural land. At first glance this seems like a sensible idea, but
like all stories it&amp;rsquo;s a simplification that ignores some important
complexities of the real world. While it can help solve some problems,
it can make other problems worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Better stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, is this really the best we can do? Do we really have to
choose between technological optimism or environmental pessimism? I
think that we can do better, and I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one. However, when
thinking and talking about sustainability, &lt;em&gt;we do need better stories&lt;/em&gt;.
If we are to truly address the difficult problems of long-term
well-being, wishful thinking will be insufficient. We cannot simply
believe that technology or more education or &amp;ldquo;going back to nature&amp;rdquo;
will fix everything. Equally it won&amp;rsquo;t help us to believe that our
problems are too big to be solved, or that the best solution is the
extinction of all humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to realise that our stories aren&amp;rsquo;t just explanations
and problem solving-tools, they are also meaning-making tools and self
protection devices, used by people to feel good about themselves. They
help determine what we want, how we want it and what we&amp;rsquo;re willing to
give up. Most people want sustainability, but they also want growth (as
a perceived part of &amp;ldquo;progress&amp;rdquo;), so we prefer &amp;ldquo;magic bullet&amp;rdquo;
solutions to ones that actually require effort or sacrifice. These magic
bullet solutions have shifted through time: from machines to &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo;
to rational planning to computers to &amp;ldquo;the market&amp;rdquo; to cryptocurrencies
and the blockchain to artificial intelligence. Besides this, many people
want to feel that they&amp;rsquo;re the hero that is &amp;ldquo;saving the world&amp;rdquo; in some
way. This in itself is not bad, but unfortunately most of the real 
problems we face do not require an individual to &amp;ldquo;save the world&amp;rdquo;. 
Instead they require hard work done collectively by many, 
many groups of people, who need to coordinate
locally, regionally and globally to analyse and solve many small
problems, preferably without causing a lot of new problems in the
process. Much of this work is already being done by people somewhere and
we can learn from their experiences and scale up our collective effort
on solutions that really work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series of articles I will look for better stories. Over the
years, many people have come up with different and occasionally
non-conventional ways of looking at and talking about sustainability,
about the nature of our main problems and the direction of possible
solutions. I believe that some of these ideas are useful, and may inform
more constructive ways of thinking and talking. They may help us build
better stories. They may help bridge the gaps between ecomodernist, 
neo-romantic and ecopessimist ways of seeing the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Science as starting point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science of course is one tool that may help us. The neat thing about
science is that it provides a toolbox for testing if our explanatory
stories are useful, based on observations and experiments. The stories
of science are often the best explanations we have for how the world
works. Still, these stories of science are necessarily simplifications,
that may be inaccurate and may miss important aspects of the world. And
scientific stories describing complex realities rarely offer single or
simple explanations. Rather they offer sets of likely alternatives. As
with all stories, when offered a choice between alternatives, we tend to
pick the explanations that suit us best. Still, at least the explanatory
stories of science constantly evolve as new observations are made and
some explanations are shown to be incomplete or incorrect. Therefore, it
is to science that we shall turn first. Specifically in the 
&lt;a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/entwined.html"&gt;next articles&lt;/a&gt; 
we will look at the fairly young science of complex systems. We
will also examine some reasons why biological life is so robust that it
has managed not just to survive but to flourish, despite several truly
cataclysmic events that occurred over the long history of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

Economist Giorgos Kallis makes the important point that self-imposed limits should probably be
set voluntarily by societies, based on values. If we wait for limits to be imposed externally by our environment, we greatly reduce our options for acting in ways that align with what is important to us.&lt;/p&gt;

In this short book, neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/antonio-damasio/"&gt;Antonio Damasio&lt;/a&gt; argues that feelings
and consciousness arose in humans and other animals to help us determine
how well our life process is going, and to act on that information. We
all seek wellbeing, because a feeling of wellbeing signals that all is
well, while feelings of stress or pain signal that there may be a
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

Much of this book is about whether free will exists. But neurobiologist and genetics researcher &lt;a href="https://www.kjmitchell.com"&gt;Kevin J. Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; also gives a clear and very readable description of how all organisms, ranging from microbes to roundworms to humans, build internal models of the world. These models are embodied in neural networks and other physiological structures and allow living beings to &lt;em&gt;do things&lt;/em&gt;, to act as agents that can cause things to happen, driven by internal goals.&lt;/p&gt;

The political scientist and anthropologist James C. Scott has pointed out that our goals determine how we structure the world, and also what our blind spots are. He shows how &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; foresters of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century and the modernist states of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century simplified the social and natural systems they worked with, in the name of efficiency, rationality and the pursuit of a utopian future. In doing so, they destroyed much of the ecological and social fabric required for systems to function well. They failed to appreciate that the &amp;ldquo;messiness&amp;rdquo; of real ecological and social systems actually contributes to their long-term resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

Biologist &lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/faculty/jvander.html"&gt;John Vandermeer&lt;/a&gt; argues that agricultural production systems are ecosystems that are to a large extent structured by humans. Agriculture is fundamentally different from an industrial production system, because agriculture is an open system in which biological, physical and chemical processes still play an important role. We cannot fully control these processes, and in fact, our attempts to do so often end up making problems worse, because they degrade natural controls and cycles. Instead of trying to maximise control, we should use ecological knowledge and try to work with natural structures and mechanisms to stabilise agricultural productivity, reduce pests and prevent the degradation of agricultural soils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/staying-with-the-trouble"&gt;https://www.dukeupress.edu/staying-with-the-trouble&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
The work of interdisciplinary ecofeminist scholar &lt;a href="https://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=haraway"&gt;Donna Haraway&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t very accessible to the general public, indeed one commenter called it a &amp;ldquo;postmodern word salad&amp;rdquo;. This is unfortunate, because readers who manage to struggle through the somewhat abstruse but also highly original and sometimes quite poetic language of Haraway can find much of interest in her writing and talks. Among many other things, she argues that we suffer from a lack of imagination in the ways we currently think and talk about sustainability. Many of our current discussions rest on either wishful thinking or on fatalism, both of which are unhelpful. She criticises the false certainties and human exceptionalism that characterise many of our narratives. Instead, we should think outside of the box and we should connect with and listen to others (including other species). According to Haraway we should also pay more attention to context, and to small personal-level stories that refuse to yield to big utopian, technocratic or apocalyptic narratives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="better-stories"></category><category term="storytelling"></category></entry></feed>
