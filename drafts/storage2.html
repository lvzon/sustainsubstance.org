<h3>Distributed solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Large-scale storage is still an unsolved problem. Large-scale battery storage is expensive, pumped hydro is limited by available space, alternatives may still need decades to development and scale up.</li>
<li>These are all centralised solutions, which makes sense in grid-context. Electricity grid is devised as a centralised and highly managed energy production and delivery system. Fossil-based energy lends itself very well to central production: most fossil energy is in coal, and while oil is easy to transport and store (making it ideal for transport), coal isn&rsquo;t. And heat engines become more efficient when they are bigger, so centralised energy extraction from coal or gas or oil wastes less of the energy. Nuclear is only feasible on a large scale, as is hydropower. Centralised energy production requires large investments.</li>
<li>Most non-fossil energy on the other hand is highly decentralised, as it is essentially based on current sunlight rather than stored sunlight. Solar power, wind, wave and tidal, and to a lesser extent geothermal. Connecting everything together in a grid makes sense, as you can compensate shortages in one location by surplus in another (see the German graph). On the other hand, it needs to be balanced, and decentralised energy production is hard to control. So a large contribution of decentral energy production does not fit well with a highly centrally managed grid.</li>
<li>It makes sense to decentralise energy storage, to fit with decentral energy production.</li>
<li>Ideally, households should produce most of the energy they consume, and consume most of the energy they produce. </li>
<li>Show graphs of individual household loads vs. sunlight, for Germany (summer/winter) and Australia. Note that in sunny periods and regions, supply and demand match much better than in a Northern European winter. This makes sense: first of all there is more energy available, less is needed for heating and light, and more is used for cooling. Renewables are a problem in winter at high latitudes, so we&rsquo;ll still need the grid, but we could cut down a lot on summer fossil energy requirements by installing solar and adding a little storage for evening use. This makes sense emission-wise, although not necessarily economics-wise (as you still need large investments).</li>
<li>But what&rsquo;s wrong with this picture? Several things. First of all, there&rsquo;s no such thing as an average household, or for that matter, an average day. Show data for some real households (German load graph from PV magazine, data from SolarEdge inverters, my own load profile). The second issue is that especially in Northern Europe, electricity use does not equal energy use. We&rsquo;d need to add the energy for heating and transport, which would make an enormous difference. (And then we&rsquo;re not even counting indirect energy use for consumption.)</li>
<li>For countries with a lot of sun, switching to solar is much easier: hot water can easily be generated during the day and stored, cooling can be powered by sunlight, EVs can be charged during the day. Decentral prodction and storage is the way to go.</li>
<li>For countries where energy use is highest in winter and during evenings, things are going to be much more tricky. Installing a few batteries might get you through a summer night, but it won&rsquo;t get you through the winter. With regard to solar PV, the most we can do is reduce fossil demand during spring and summer.</li>

<h3>But is it sustainable?</h3>
<p>At first glance, promoting PV-systems with battery storage would seem to be a favourable measure in terms of sustainability, for at least two reasons. Firstly, adding battery storage may make the adoption of solar energy more attractive in many countries. And secondly, storing solar and wind energy reduces the need to keep fossil-fuel power stations around as backup during nights and periods with little wind.</p>
<p>From a sustainability-perspective, the main reason to promote household- or company-scale PV-installations is that any electricity they produce will not have to be generated from fossil fuels. Countries like Germany or The Netherlands have it relatively easy for households to adopt PV solar panels: just have a PV-system installed on your house or company building, and hook it up to the grid. The grid operator then pays you money (up to a point) for the electricity you generate but don&rsquo;t use yourself. This is probably the main reason why solar energy is so widespread in Germany, even though it is not exactly the sunniest country in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TODO: look up peak capacity and % of solar energy in Germany (and NL), as well as effective insolation (W/m2 and compared to places in Southern Europe, the Saharah, Australia and the US). Compare with % solar energy in Italy, Spain, Australia and US. Note that this system is effective but expensive (look up cost estimation for NL and Germany in terms of subsidies / tax money).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average total horizontal irradiance in Germany between 1981 and 2010 stands at 1055 kWh/m2 per year and fluctuates according to location between approximately 951 and 1257 kWh/m2 per year. Tilting the PV modules increases the total incident irradiance on the modules by around 15 percent compared to the horizontal surface. This increases the average incident irradiation to roughly 1200 kWh/m2 per year throughout Germany.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Germans pay a surcharge on the grid-energy they use, which is then used to pay for the feed-in tariff. On the costs side, the cumulative amount paid for PV power fed into the grid up to and including 2013 amounted to around 41 billion euros. Energy consumers therefore pay for the energy transition. Fossil fuels however are subsidised by public money. If these costs were also to be added to the electricity price as a ‘conventional energy tariff,’ they would amount to 10.2 cts/kWh, which is almost three times the value of the Renewable Energy Tariff in 2012.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At first glance, yes. </p>
</li>
<li>The idea of promoting home-scale PV is that any electricity it produces, will not have to be produced from fossil fuels. <ul>
<li>Germany: Based on data from 2013 giving the proportional amount of power generated from each energy source and the primary energy factors, each kWh of PV-generated electricity saved about 2.2 kWh of primary energy. In 2013, total primary energy savings amounted to 65 TWh. The consumption of 28 TWh PV electricity in 2012 avoided greenhouse gas emissions on the order of 18.6 million tons of CO2 equivalent.</li>
<li>Germany has a (granted, somewhat ambitious) scenario for completely switching to renewables by 2050.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In countries like Germany and The Netherlands, this is easy: you hook up your PV-installation to the grid, and you get money for electricity you produce. This is why PV is so widely installed in Germany, even though it is not exactly the sunniest country in the world. </li>
<li>In many countries the situation is different, you don&rsquo;t get any money for the power you produce, so your financial gain comes from using the power you produce yourself (thereby saving money on grid-power). In these cases it makes sense to install a battery, to make sure you can actually use all the power your panels produce during the day.</li>
<li>
<p>Especially if such countries are sunny (e.g. Australia and the US), affordable batteries may speed up the adoption of PV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a sustainability perspective, there is a catch. Batteries are not free, they cost not only money but also energy to produce.</p>
</li>
<li>Actually, quite a lot of energy. (How much?)</li>
<li>Add to that the energy needed to produce the solar panels and inverter. </li>
<li>How long is the EROI? And how long before the carbon emissions become negative?<ul>
<li>A solar plant’s energy payback time depends on the technology used and the plant’s location. For an annual global horizontal irradiance of 1055 kWh/m2 , which is the mean value for Germany, this takes approximately two years, and falling with better manufacturing techniques. Wind power plants in Germany demonstrate even shorter energy pay back times ranging from 2-7 months. (Fraunhoffer).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presumably, battery recycling can at least reduce the manufacturing energy and material requirements. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, from a &ldquo;weak sustainability&rdquo; perspective, PV makes sense after some time (with or without battery). </p>
</li>
<li>Weak, in the sense that it reduces the use of fossil energy somewhat, for every house with PV. </li>
<li>
<p>But if it stays connected to the grid, you still need a full traditional grid-infrastructure as backup. That is, PV hardly reduces the maximum demand at night. Large-scale adoption of batteries <em>would</em> help reduce this. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But many claim that the point of PV is to <em>replace</em> a fossil-derived electricity production system.</p>
</li>
<li>This means that enough stored energy must be available at night to offset the absence of sun. (Assuming that power-cables from the other side of the world are not a realistic option in the short term.)</li>
<li>How many batteries would you need for the US? (Musk claims not that much - how much energy would this require to produce? How much would this cost? Who would pay for this?)</li>
<li>Enough big numbers. Let&rsquo;s start small and keep the examples managable: scale of one house. Let&rsquo;s say the goal would be to take your house off-grid. (This could be attractive for more reasons than just sustainability.) (It would mean that the cost of maintaining a grid would go up for everyone else - but lets ignore that for a moment.)</li>
<li>Using Tesla&rsquo;s Powerwall, we&rsquo;d need the daily cycling model (7 kWh).<ul>
<li>Neat trick: using a 10 kWh battery at 70% DoD, plus thermal and load management.</li>
<li>Max. power is a problem, if you want to go fully off-grid. How many batteries would be needed to cover load peaks (washing machines, water cookers, ovens, etc.) at night?</li>
<li>Depends on where you live, how much electricity you use at what times, and how many solar panels you have. </li>
<li>Look up typical electricity use curve for several countries, how much capacity would be needed for one night?</li>
<li>How much surplus solar energy is needed to charge this capacity during the day? </li>
<li>Would probably require a fair number of panels in winter, how much in e.g. NL/DE?</li>
<li>Becomes more interesting when additive to electric car storage, could be combined with low-power lighting, smart grid equipment to limit peak loads etc. Good excercise in reducing power use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The role of electrical transport</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using EVs to store power and reduce fossil fuel use.</li>
<li>Current EV battery capacity is ~16 kWh for a plug-in hybrid, ~24 kWh for a passenger EV and ~50 kWh for a transport van. Assuming 67% DoD, the effective capacities are 10, 16 and 33 kWh. The Tesla model S has a bigger range than the typical 100 miles, and 40-90 kWh capacity (effectively less) for 240 mi (390 km) - 265 mi (426 km) of driving. Part of this could be used for storage, although some should of course remain for driving in the morning. But few people will want/need to drive 250 miles / 400 km every morning.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn up the heat</h3>
<ul>
<li>What about cold winters? Batteries aren&rsquo;t going to help us much there, and switching from gas to electric is just going to make matters worse on grid-scale.</li>
<li>With regard to heating, we can still do a lot better than we do now! Burning fossil fuels to heat up the air in our homes is a terrible way to use energy. Electric heating by itself is even worse (unless the electricity is generated from hydro). Biomass is not a solution, we&rsquo;ve been there - it was called the Middle Ages. We simply would need too much energy now. </li>
<li>There&rsquo;s an upside: Heat is actually much easier to store than electricity! </li>
<li>We can and should make much better use of thermal energy than we do now. Don&rsquo;t just see it as a waste-product.</li>
<li>Collecting it is no problem, especially in summer: Heat collectors, thermal storage, both on power-plant and residential scale. <ul>
<li>Hybrid concentrating solar collectors (&ldquo;sunflowers&rdquo;) as example of a CPVT-system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrator_photovoltaics#Concentrated_photovoltaics_and_thermal). Airlight/Dsolar&rsquo;s parabolic solar dishes track and concentrate solar (12 kW PV + 21 kW thermal), and use several tricks to reduce material use (thin film mirrors, concenterating light on small PV chips instead of panels, transparent inflatable cover, fiber-based concrete structure rather than steel/aluminium). Hot-water cooling technology, developed by IBM to cool CPUs, cools PV chips and generate hot water (for heating/cooling/desalination). http://www.zurich.ibm.com/news/14/dsolar.html</li>

<li>Problems: http://www.solarblogger.net/2012/10/hybrid-pv-thermal-solar-panels-good-idea.html</li>
<li>Proven technology: solar collector, thermal buffer, heat pump.</li>
<li>Are there options for molten salt as small-scale storage, heated by concentrated sunlight during the day, e.g. for cooking and heating?</li>
<li>Sorption cooling (thermally driven cooling) is an interesting alternative to using electrical heat pumps. There are other techniques: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_air_conditioning</li>
<li>Thermochemical heat storage is also interesting: https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2014/march/sorption-energy-storage.html</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The hard part is converting heat back to electricity.<ul>
<li>We do this all the time: combustion engines and steam engines work by converting fossil fuel into heat, and then into movement. In power gerenators, movement is then converted into electricity. It&rsquo;s a ludicrous process if you think about it. Again, we only get away with it because fossil fuel contains so much energy that we can currently afford to waste most of it.</li>
<li>What is the efficiency of turning low-grade heat into electricity. What are the techniques available? Is this feasible on a small scale?</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s terrible. Mostly less than 5% or so.</li>
<li>Thermoelectric generators currently have low output and efficiency, and require high temperatures. Things are improving with nanostructures, but only very slowly. Don&rsquo;t expect any short-term breakthroughs that will allow this to be feasible for small-scale thermal storage at decent capacities.</li>

<h3>Hurdles and alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve seen that the Powerwall could contribute to sustainability of the electricity supply, but with a lot of ifs and maybes, and it won&rsquo;t be cheap.</li>
<li>Biggest challenges: Life span needs to go up, production energy cost and carbon need to go down.</li>
<li>For it to catch on a significant scale, probably fossil fuel needs to become more expensive first (which would unfortunately also raise the price of the equipment).</li>
<li>And then still: remember that we have become very used to being able to get large amounts of energy cheaply whenever we want to (at least 16A @230V in NL for a normal house, ~3.8kW). Our lifestyle has become dependent on <em>a lot</em> of power always being available, in the form of gas, electricity, gasoline and diesel.</li>
<li>
<p>Energy transition will probably be a bumpy ride. It always is, but it usually also comes with benefits. Last time the benefit was cheap and abundant energy. This will probably not be the case this time, at least not for a while. (Oil gives you <em>a lot</em> of stored energy basically for free, you just have to pump it up.) But at the very least, a diverse and decentralised power supply for the world would certainly be more robust and in a sense more democratic (people would become responsible for locally generating the power they (directly) use, and countries would be less dependent on other countries far away for their energy). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about alternatives for storage? Li-ion is a fairly complicated and not very robust technology. Lots of electronics is needed to manage charge and discharge. If it gets too warm, it breaks. And it&rsquo;s all highly integrated, so if it breaks, you basically have to replace the entire thing.</p>
</li>
<li>Alternative battery technologies: Low-tech iron batteries (could be cheap, without deep-cycling problems), high-tech redox flow (for utility scale). </li>
<li>Pumped storage is very simple. Could maybe be used more at sea or in disused mines, but as it requires large volumes/weights (due to low density) it isn&rsquo;t really practical on a small scale, unless you happen to own a reservoir on a hill.<ul>
<li>For the 3 Wh of energy stored in an AA battery, you&rsquo;d need a mass of 360 kg, or about 800 lb at 3m height.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flywheels and compressed air are also relatively efficient and low-tech, but not really feasible (as in: too bulky and dangerous) for storage on a small scale.</li>
<li>Rather than (or in addition to) storage, bring down electricity use, and mostly use it at times when it is available. But despite much talk of and investment in smart grids, their impact so far is practically nonexistent. It is still a big mess of competing standards, with not much real-world applications to speak so far. Current applications do not proceed much beyond the pilot-project stage, and no-one basically knows yet how to organise a practical large-scale smart-grid. Certainly the technology is there, but it is an almost intractable organisational problem, and will probably remain so for a fair number of years.</li>
<li>But don&rsquo;t stand waiting around for new technology, especially with thermal energy. We still waste most of our high-grade energy (fossil and electrical) by turning it into heat! (And most of that escapes.)</li>
<li>And installing PV won&rsquo;t immediately solve the energy problem, but it goes a litle way. And at least investing in storage solutions and smart grids becomes more interesting as PV-production capacity increases.</li>
