            <p><strong>By Levien van Zon</strong> <br>
<em>Reading time: &hellip; minutes</em></p>
<p>Recap:
 - It seems that the &ldquo;big three&rdquo; non-fossil energy sources cannot grow much.<br>
 - Luckily there are energy sources that still can be seriously scaled up: Wind and especially solar. There is also some potential geothermal, as well as for wave and other &ldquo;blue&rdquo; energy and watermills, but it is more limited.
 - The problem: currently these sources provide &lt;2%. How on earth are they going to take over the 80% or so that fossil fuels currently provide? 
 - Part of the answer: they might not have to. We might be able to reduce our current energy use by half.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recap energy sources and scale. We use a lot of fossil energy. Where does all this energy go? </li>
<li>Surprise: a third of primary energy is &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; due to inefficiencies and overhead.</li>
<li>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just in the energy system - industrial installations, homes, offices and transport also waste a large fraction of the energy they get from fossil fuels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss difference between primary and end-use energy: fossil fuels are rather inefficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fossil fuel mining and conversion and transport require energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transport sector uses a lot of energy, and also wastes most of it. Show how much energy an aeroplane uses. Explain energy requirements and energy balance of a car. Only a tiny fraction of the energy from fuel goes into moving the actual driver. For aeroplanes this is even worse, as the thing has to fight not just air friction but also gravity, in order to get and stay airborne. This is why Elon Musk proposed the Hyperloop as an alternative to flying, and the future of driving is probably in electric vehicles. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infrastructure, agriculture etc. use a fair amount of energy, but this is important as we need food and schools and hospitals and government services. People easily forget that building and maintaining things requires a lot of energy. But most inefficiency is probably in heating and cooling. In winter we burn fossil fuels to heat up our buildings, in summer we burn fossil fuels to cool them. There are smarter ways to do this. There are building techniques that keep the heat in (insulation) or out. Even with current technology, we can fairly easily store heat in summer and extract it again in winter, sgnificantly reducing energy use for heating. Also, we&rsquo;re still heating spaces with the windows open, heating or cooling spaces when they&rsquo;re not used, etc. So even without any structural modifications, we can already reduce energy use for heating and cooling, just by improving control systems and changing human behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Industry: uses energy not just to produce the stuff we use (consumer goods), but also the equipment we need in other sectors. Use fossil fuels both as material resource and energy resource. Part used in mining, lot of energy used in melting stuff. Metals and chemical industry are obvious examples, but even electronics and things like solar panels require high temperature and pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimate how much energy is effectively needed, after inefficiencies are subtracted. Large difference, so large opportunity for reduction!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also here, we are looking at average energy use. Note that average transport energy use won&rsquo;t get us very far.</p>
</li>
<li>Show differences between countries. Note that air and boat travel isn&rsquo;t included. </li>
<li>Complication for country stats: lot of industry is export-oriented, and we import a lot of industrial products from other cuntries.</li>
<li>This especially distorts the Asian country stats, as China produces large fraction of the world&rsquo;s industrial products.</li>
<li>Explain energy footprint. Import adds around a third to the energy footprint of consumer societies (notably Europe, N-America, Australia, N-Zealand, Japan). Show example for UK. Do we have information for other countries?</li>
<li>
<p>Show energy requirements for some products/activities? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mention focus on &ldquo;energy savings&rdquo; by reducing standby consumption. &ldquo;Every little helps&rdquo; vs. we need big reductions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significant energy reduction possible in built environment (better insulation and smarter heating), industry (example of PV-production), transport (less and smaller cars, self-driving electrical transport), energy sector itself (switching to alternative sources and conversion already helps - although we also require energy to produce things like solar panels and batteries).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even when reduced, we will still need a lot of energy, and this will increase due to population growth and development. As mentioned, solar and wind energy supplemented by geothermal, hydro, biomass, nuclear and some smaller sources may provide most of it. The next article will look at some of the opportunities and difficulties of scaling up solar energy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO / look up:
 - more detailed data on energy use of sectors
 - estimates of specific losses (transport, mining, etc.)
 - energy use of flying, from earlier notes
 - energy balance of cars/driving (from MacKay?)
 - check energy requirements for electronics and PV
 - check energy needs for making plastic bottles (from references in VK-article)
 - differences between TPES and end-use
 - import-export balances for various countries
 - consumer energy footprints of various countries (UK from MacKay, US, Germany, NL? Also check earlier notes.)
 - Make some figures of energy footprints (breakdown and vs. TPES &amp; end-use).</p>
<p>Check this figure: http://www.iea.org/Sankey/</p>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong>
   - Say something about the energy footprint relative to the TPES for a country. Roughly this adds about a third to the energy use of affluent countries. Use UK as an example, show 
   - Make a graph of end-use sectors per country, for several countries/regions (at least US, UK, Germany, France, NL, Africa, Asia, China, maybe Brazil if we can get it)</p>
<p>We humans currently use over 430 billion kWh of energy <em>per day</em>. That&rsquo;s a very large number, and therefore a lot of energy. And it begs the question: What do we use all this energy for?</p>
<div style="display: block; margin: 30px 0; width: 80vw; margin-left: 50%; -webkit-transform: translateX(-50%); -moz-transform: translateX(-50%); -ms-transform: translateX(-50%); -o-transform: translateX(-50%); transform: translateX(-50%);">

</div>

<p>The figure above shows where our energy comes from, and what we use it for. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at it. We already talked a little about where our energy comes from, so we&rsquo;ll start with the right side: Where does the energy go?</p>
<p>For most of us, including myself, this figure reveals a rather stunning surprise: Almost a third (31%) of our energy supply isn&rsquo;t really used for anything! Part of this energy goes into the mining process of fossil fuels. The rest goes into transport and storage, or is lost in conversion: in refining fuels, in converting them to electricity and transporting this electricity. </p>
<p>Another 10-14% or so of our energy supply (up to three-quarters of the &ldquo;transport&rdquo; energy) is lost due to the inefficiency of internal combustion engines. This means that only around half of our energy supply (±55%) is effectively available for use by us humans. And we can probably assume that much of our use of this is also unnecessarily wasteful, but let&rsquo;s ignore that for now (I will talk about that in a later article).</p>
<p>A small fraction, around 6% of our fossil fuel supply, is not used for energy but is used for the production of plastics and other materials. We actually use less than half of our global energy sources (44%, or 24 kWh per human per day) to power all our industry, services, infrastructure, agriculture and our houses. Of this energy, about three quarters is used in the form of heat, and around a quarter is currently used in the form of electricity. A further 5% or so of our global energy supply (roughly 3 kWh per human per day) is effectively used to move stuff and people around (if we don&rsquo;t count the energy lost as heat in combustion engines).</p>
<p>These figures are strange if you think about them for a bit. How can we use only 24 kWh per person per day for almost everything we do, including all our work and infrastructure, if the average electrified home already uses 10 kWh of electricity per day? Also the energy available for transport won&rsquo;t get us very far, perhaps 10 km per person per day, and that&rsquo;s including air traffic. Most of us reading this will travel a lot more on average, as does the stuff we buy. </p>
<p><em>About those regional and country differences: 
In Africa, most energy comes from biomass, mostly wood used for cooking.
In Europe and the US, it’s quite a different picture.
What these countries have in common is that they use a lot of oil, at least double the world average (?), most of which is for transport.
Most use some combination of coal and gas for electricity, heating and industry.
Some exceptions: Lot of nuclear in France, lot of hydro power in Norway (provides most of the “green” electricity in Northern Europe), lot of natural gas in NL (has to do with greenhouses).
US just uses a lot of everything.</em></p>
<p><em>So, what do we learn from this? Firstly, we use a lot of energy, especially in &ldquo;developed&rdquo; nations. Why? We use/need energy to drive to work, to the supermarket, drive the children to/from school, drive or fly to our holiday destinations, build roads, build houses and offices, heat them, cool them, run computers and servers, farm food, transport food, store food, and produce the mountains of other stuff we constantly buy. In a small village in Africa, South America or Asia, this will probably be a different story.</em></p>
<p><em>Second, almost all of this comes from fossil fuels, with only a few exceptions. Almost none is provided directly by solar or wind. Especially solar lags behind: world-wide, less than a percent, and for western countries, even the leading ones, it is rarely more.</em> </p>
<p><em>Third, we waste most of our energy, almost certainly more than half, probably closer to 75%. Most losses occur in energy conversion and in the transport sector, but large efficiency gains are possible in industry and houses and offices as well. As losses are so significant, if we manage to reduce energy losses and waste, we&rsquo;d be well on our way to slash our energy consumption.</em></p>
<p><em>Fourth, most of our energy is used in the form of heat, while sustainable energy efforts tend to be more focussed on electricity. Understandable, as you can easily convert electricity into heat. But it&rsquo;s a bit of a waste: electricity is hard to come by, while heat is relatively easy to come by, it is a by-product of nearly everything. Also, compared to electricity, it is relatively easy to store, although it is much harder to transport. More on the role of heat energy in later articles.</em></p>
<p><em>It seems that there is plenty of room for improvement, right?
In the next article I will examine the potential for non-fossil energy sources.</em></p>

<p>Of course, there are some exceptions, such as China. Moreover, absolute energy use is still rather high for Asia and Latin America, simply because so many people live there. As people in the West often point out, China is the world&rsquo;s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, as well as the world&rsquo;s biggest consumer of coal. This is true, but in fact most of this energy is used for making export products. And even if we would count everything as domestic energy use, the population of China is so big that it comes down to only around 72 kWh per person per day, just above world average but well below the energy use of European countries.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:china" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
