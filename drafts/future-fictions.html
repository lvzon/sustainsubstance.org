            <h4>On Progress, Decline and the need for active Hope</h4>
<p>Reading time: ca. 20&ndash;30 minutes</p>
<p><strong>By Levien van Zon</strong></p>
<p>As an <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/20/no-predict/">unidentified</a> Danish politician quipped in the late 1930s: <em>It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future</em>.<sup id="fnref:bohrquote"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bohrquote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>At the end of 2024, British car manufacturer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_Land_Rover">Jaguar Land Rover</a> (JLR) <a href="https://static-assets.tatamotors.com/Production/www-tatamotors-com-NEW/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/JLR-Q3-FY25-Financial-Statement-vF.pdf">reported</a> a positive outlook for 2025, the year ahead. Sales were increasing, especially in the US, and revenue and profits were exceptionally high. Of course there were some challenges and problems, but in general the future seemed very bright. Two months later, Donald Trump was inaugurated as US president, and he immediately raised tariffs on imported cars. Then, in August 2025, Jaguar Land Rover was hit by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/20/jaguar-land-rover-hack-factories-cybersecurity-jlr">cyber attack</a>. All computer systems and production lines had to be shut down for more than five weeks. Within a few short months, the 103-year old car manufacturer went from reaping record profits to writing significant <a href="https://media.production.jlrms.com/2025-11-14/pdf/e888d0db-ddb3-4160-baef-1a9552f149a8/Q2%20FY26%20Results%20Deck%20vF.pdf">losses</a>. And shareholders and company management clearly (and unsurprisingly) failed to see this coming.</p>
<h3>Black Swans and future blindness</h3>
<p>The above may seem like an exceptional situation, but what happened to Jaguar Land Rover really isn&rsquo;t an exception. It is notoriously difficult to predict how well a company or an economy will do in the near future, because unexpected things can and do happen. But this doesn&rsquo;t stop us from trying: companies and governments churn out a steady stream of quarterly and annual forecasts and economic predictions. We collectively pretend that we can look into the future, but these predictions actually mean very little. They extrapolate perceived trends and may mention some expected risks, but by definition they do not include the unpredictable. And yet it is the unexpected that usually has the biggest impact. The thinker and trader <a href="https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a> calls this a <em>Black Swan</em>: an unexpected event or trend that ends up having a significant impact, precisely because most people did not see it coming. Examples include the 2008 global banking crisis, and the al-Qaeda terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Further, more gradual examples include the <em>actual</em> long-term impacts of technologies such as the Internet and smartphones, rather than the effects that were imagined beforehand.</p>
<p>Of course there are always people who correctly predict the unexpected, or who cause it to happen. The European powers were surprised when Germany invaded Poland in 1939, but presumably Adolf Hitler was not. &ldquo;Unexpected&rdquo; and &ldquo;unpredictable&rdquo; are relative terms. Also, they are mostly about the timing and impact of events or trends. We can be certain that recessions, earthquakes, epidemics and armed conflicts will occur in the future, as they have in the past. But we cannot know exactly <em>where</em>, <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> they will happen. Also, we know with certainty that the global climate is changing, but the precise effects on regional climates and weather are hard to predict. And it is even harder to know the subsequent impacts on communities and societies, let alone how societies in turn will respond.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/entwined.html">earlier</a> article I talked about <em>complex adaptive systems</em>. I emphasised that the behaviour of such systems is <em>inherently</em> very hard to predict. Our societies and economies are complex adaptive systems, so we cannot predict their future very well. Yet we often <em>behave as if we can</em>. People tend to feel unreasonably certain about their knowledge, and also about their ability to predict a future that is inherently unpredictable. Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls this <em>epistemic arrogance</em>: a misplaced trust in our knowledge, especially our knowledge of the future.<sup id="fnref:epistemic_arrogance"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:epistemic_arrogance">2</a></sup> 
This arrogance also causes us to rationalise the unexpected after the fact: &ldquo;We could have seen this coming!&rdquo; While it is very hard to correctly predict the future, we find it very easy to come up with stories to explain it once it has passed. We often feel that what happened should really have been obvious all along, an effect known as <em>hindsight bias</em>.</p>
<h3>Simulating the future</h3>
<p>As I discussed in my <a href="https://sustainsubstance.org/thoughts-feelings-stories.html">previous</a> article, we use narratives or stories to help explain and understand our world. Narratives are about causes and effects, but they can also invoke strong feelings. And importantly, stories can be shared between people. They shape our social identity and they help us classify things as &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo;. Narratives impose order and coherence on a world that would otherwise seem chaotic and confusing.</p>
<p>Stories can be about the past, the present, the future or about wholly imagined worlds. And no matter whether they are about real or imagined events, they always shape our expectations about the future. This is tied up with a remarkable ability we have, known as <em>mental simulation</em>, <em>mental time travel</em> or <em>mobile consciousness</em>. This is our ability to construct scenes in our imagination and transport ourselves into these scenes as observers or actors.</p>
<p>We constantly run mental simulations about what happened in the past, what could have happened differently and what may happen in the future. This is absolutely central to the way humans experience the world.<sup id="fnref:mentalsimulation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mentalsimulation">3</a></sup> The areas of the brain responsible for these mental simulations are active much of the time, which is why they are collectively known as the <em>default mode network</em>. This is also why mindfulness meditation is so hard (at least initially): Our mind naturally drifts to simulate other times and places, especially when it isn&rsquo;t occupied by some other task that requires our full attention. It takes significant effort and attention to remain in the &ldquo;here and now&rdquo;. It is hard to suppress the tendency of our mind to wander off and simulate things.<sup id="fnref:defaultmode"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:defaultmode">4</a></sup> (It is even hard to notice that we&rsquo;re doing it!)</p>
<p>When we think about the future, we simulate it by imagining &ldquo;possible worlds&rdquo;. We take selected trends or examples from the past and present, and we project these into imaginary future scenarios. The scenarios we use to simulate the future are usually based on our experiences, and on the stories we have been exposed to. Our culture and social groups are a rich source of &ldquo;grand narratives&rdquo;, stories that we share and consume, and which can act as templates for our mental simulations. </p>
<h3>Futures better or worse</h3>
<p>When we think about the future of humanity or of a society, we broadly use one of two story templates. One is the narrative of Progress, in which the future will be better than the past. The other is the narrative of Decline, in which the past was better than the present or the future.<sup id="fnref:apocalypse"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:apocalypse">5</a></sup> And because the human mind is anything but consistent, we often switch between these two views, depending on our mood, social context, subject, age and other factors.</p>
<p>The most common expectation we have about the future is probably that it will be more or less the same as the present. But because this isn&rsquo;t really an interesting narrative, it isn&rsquo;t shared much.<sup id="fnref:narrative"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:narrative">6</a></sup> 
Of the future-oriented narratives we do share, that of Decline has historically been the most prominent. The Ancient Greeks believed that their society was in decline after a golden age.<sup id="fnref:ancientdecline"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ancientdecline">7</a></sup> Many of the great religions are centred around a story of moral decline, and therefore a necessity for saviour, redemption or enlightenment. In 18<sup>th</sup> century Europe, Romanticism was a response to what was perceived as social decline due to the increasing role of money, profit and trade. Connected to this was the idea of genetic and cultural decline due to racial mixing with &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; people, which gained popularity in 19<sup>th</sup> century Europe and some of its colonies. This culminated in the 20<sup>th</sup> century rise of fascism and eventually in the Holocaust. Also our modern age features prominent stories of Decline, revolving for instance around climate change, mass-immigration or artificial intelligence.</p>
<h3>Optimism and negativity</h3>
<p>In general we think more in terms of decline as we get older. Our physical state declines, and we may start to idealise memories from our past. Changes in the world around us make us uncertain about what the future may bring. Moreover, negative emotions (such as fear) more effectively capture our attention than positive emotions. This bias is known as the <em>negativity effect</em>.  It causes us to pay more attention to negative events than to positive news. We therefore tend to overestimate the probability of bad things happening. At least, when it comes to the actions of other people, or external forces we cannot control.<sup id="fnref:negativity"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:negativity">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly the negativity effect does not apply (strongly) to our own actions. When it comes to the things we feel we can control, we actually tend to <em>underestimate</em> the probability of bad things happening. We overestimate our chances of success, and underestimate the risk of setbacks. This is known as <em>optimism bias</em>. This relative blindness to obstacles is one of the reasons why we don&rsquo;t see Black Swan events coming, even when there are clear signs (as with the 2008 financial crisis).    <br>
The combination of optimism bias with the negativity effect implies the following: We are at the same time too pessimistic about the world in general, <em>and</em> too optimistic about our own abilities and the success of our social groups. Such a double bias may seem like a bad thing, but these biases do serve an important function. The negativity effect makes us risk-averse in the wider world, beyond the protection of our social groups. This is a sensible approach if you want to enhance your chances of survival. At the same time, positivity bias provides the motivation to try new things when we feel safe. Our overestimation of success spurs us to invest in our future, even when the actual, objective chances of success are not that great. It motivates us to take risks when the potential gains are higher than the perceived risks. Positivity bias is therefore a potent driver of creativity, progress and social change.</p>
<h3>Bright futures</h3>
<p>This brings us to the second major story template when thinking about the future: the narrative of Progress. In the context of our own life stories, we are happiest when we feel we are progressing toward some kind of meaningful goal. But as a major <em>social</em> narrative, Progress is relatively new. Medieval Europeans generally didn&rsquo;t consider the future as something they could influence very much. Rather, fate and divine providence were leading concepts when thinking about the future. The Enlightenment however weakened the existing social order and the role of religious narratives. It promoted individual freedom and the development of scientific knowledge. This mainstreamed the idea that we can influence and improve our future, through individual and collective action. One of the consequences was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Revolution">string of popular revolutions</a> in Europe and the Americas between 1765 and 1848. Another consequence was economic theory.</p>
<p>The Enlightenment gave rise to at least two strands of Progress thinking. One centered on collective action toward social improvement. This school of thinking eventually led to the ideologies of Socialism and Communism. But in general it inspired the many movements that fought against repressive social systems and for the emancipation of workers, common citizens, slaves, women, Afro-Americans and other social groups.    <br>
The other strand originated with liberal thinkers who did not feel all together comfortable with the idea of self-determination for the masses, and the social unrest that came with it. This school of thinking preferred to frame Progress as a natural law. In this view, history shows that Progress occurs by itself, through economic growth, human ingenuity and technological development. It is driven by the competitive dynamics of the free market, through commercial innovation and individual consumption.<sup id="fnref:innovation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:innovation">9</a></sup>  It works best if left alone, and should ideally be <em>protected against</em> collective action. </p>
<h3>Progress and (in)stability</h3>
<p>Thinking of Progress as an active process, a collective fight for social improvement, is clearly very powerful. It helped shape the freedoms that many of us enjoy today. It also <em>inherently</em> destabilises societies in their existing form, because the whole point of social change is to move beyond the status quo. Therefore, the concept of Progress as an active, collective process is unattractive to those who feel they have something to lose.<sup id="fnref:conservative_elite"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:conservative_elite">10</a></sup>   <br>
On the other hand, thinking of Progress as something that happens more or less automatically can be a stabilising force. Especially if people really do experience the present as being better than the past, in at least <em>some</em> ways. In many modern states, the idea of Progress became gradually detached from collective action and came to be regarded as an &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; stabilising background process, a kind of invisible hand guiding humanity. Moreover, progress was institutionalised as something that can be measured and to some degree managed by experts. During the Cold War, Progress and especially economic growth were seen as measures of cultural success by both the West and the Communist powers. Today we still express national success mostly in terms of economic metrics, such as unemployment rate and growth of GDP. </p>
<h3>Problems of Progress</h3>
<p>Modern narratives of Progress place a strong emphasis on economic progress and technological development. One particularly influential view holds that there is little need to solve problems collectively through forward planning, because most problems will be solved in the near future through technological innovation and economic growth.<sup id="fnref:neoliberalism"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:neoliberalism">11</a></sup> There are however issues with this vision of the future, of which I shall mention two.</p>
<p>First, this vision of Progress is based on a simplified narrative of the past three centuries or so, one that puts too much emphasis on the role of technology. Certainly, technology has played a significant role, but it was often a secondary one. If we define Progress as an increase in human wellbeing, its main drivers were mostly <em>not</em> technological. Rather, progress was largely based on the huge increase in human knowledge that resulted from the scientific revolution<sup id="fnref:science"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:science">12</a></sup>, coupled with education, popular emancipation and significant shifts in moral thinking.
Infectious human diseases were greatly suppressed, which was a very impressive feat. But it was done through a few relatively simple interventions. Disease transmission chains were broken through hand washing, heating (to sterilise food and medical equipment), and by separating human waste from drinking water. Antibiotics and vaccination campaigns probably contributed the most to human health and life span. But vaccines fully rely on the human immune system, which evolved over millions of years, while antibiotics were discovered more or less accidentally. Most antibiotics are natural substances evolved by fungi or bacteria to keep other fungi or bacteria at bay. Much of human Progress actually comes from a discovery of nature, rather than through the development of machines.   <br>
Many other aspects of improved human wellbeing have even less to do with technology. Rather, they result from moral and social progress, shifts in what we collectively consider acceptable and unacceptable. These moral shifts were promoted by the emergence of new concepts, such as &ldquo;human rights&rdquo;, and by collective action in the past.</p>
<p>The second issue is that Progress is often framed as something occurring along a single dimension, a single line on which we should always move forward.<sup id="fnref:progressportrayal"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:progressportrayal">13</a></sup> Aspects of what we call Progress can certainly be positive, but that&rsquo;s hardly the end of it. A development that is positive in one sense can have negative side effects, although these are often not immediately clear. Progress in one area of life can lead to decline in other areas.<sup id="fnref:exportingdecline"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:exportingdecline">14</a></sup> For instance, large-scale industrial farming has resulted in a surplus of cheap foods. This has greatly reduced famine and undernutrition, but it has also caused several new problems. These include a strong dependency on mined, non-renewable resources, as well as a pandemic of chronic disease and a global decline in insect populations, tree cover and biodiversity. Similarly, antibiotics have saved innumerable lives over the past century. But their overuse has caused widespread antibiotic resistance, reducing our <em>future</em> options for suppressing pathogens. And last but not least, cheap fossil fuels have made possible our modern world, with all its complexity and its comforts. But burning these fuels has also triggered changes in the global climate that will have unforeseen consequences for centuries to come. </p>
<p>Like any story about the future, the narrative of Progress is based on a certain, selective way of viewing the past and the present. Much of what we regard as progress now may actually sabotage or reverse our wellbeing in the future. In fact, this latter insight is at the core of many Decline narratives.   <br>
Advocates of Progress argue that progress will occur in the future because it has occurred in the past. But this is an arbitrary extrapolation. The future hasn&rsquo;t happened yet and it offers few guarantees. Moreover, the past is <em>also</em> a narrative, a mental simulation of what happened, based on incomplete and selected information.</p>
<h3>Motivational thinking and multiversionality</h3>
<p>Yet, all this doesn&rsquo;t mean that Progress is a bad narrative. Granted, it&rsquo;s a complete fiction, but it&rsquo;s certainly a useful one. First of all, our current, modern society isn&rsquo;t able to function without a belief in future Progress. While this is not <em>necessarily</em> a good thing, it is a reality that we do need to recognise before we can deal with it. As argued by the sociologist <a href="https://www.mpifg.de/beckert_en">Jens Beckert</a>, most economic decisions are future-oriented, and they cannot be conducted without holding assumptions about the future. Because we cannot really know what the <em>actual</em> future will be, we base our decisions on &ldquo;fictional expectations&rdquo;. These are collectively imagined scenarios of what the future will be like. In the context of economics, such fictional expectations are produced by expert opinions, theoretical models and various kinds of forecasts. We all need to make decisions in a complex, uncertain economic world. These should preferably be nonrandom and be more or less coordinated with other people. We do this by collectively pretending that our fictional expectations more or less represent the actual future. But in fact, they rarely do: economic and technological forecasts have a dismal record of accuracy. Beckert suggests however that forecasts do not <em>need</em> to be accurate, they merely need to be sufficiently convincing to generate the confidence needed for decisions on, say, investment. And because investment is needed for innovation and economic growth, an expectation of (economic) Progress is required for the system to work.<sup id="fnref:capitalism"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:capitalism">17</a></sup> But this expectation is also self-fulfilling to some extent: it inspires the behaviour that generates Progress in the first place.<sup id="fnref:performativity"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:performativity">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Apart from their foundational role in economics, Progress narratives are important in other ways as well. The idea that Progress is possible, is in itself empowering. It can motivate us to improve current conditions through individual or collective action. In fact, a similar argument can be made for the narratives of Decline. The idea of social or natural decline can feel disempowering, if we feel we have no agency. But it can also motivate us to take action, to solve problems in the present and prevent likely problems in the future. Progress and Decline are both narrative fictions, but we <em>do need</em> such fictions to engage with the future.</p>
<p>As Fritz Breithaupt puts it in his book <em>The Narrative Brain</em>, we constantly see ourselves as being in the middle of a narrative, and we mentally project different versions of how this narrative may progress. Breithaupt calls this <em>mental multiversionality</em>. Our mental simulations determine how we feel about and prepare for the future, and they need to be fed with scenarios and possible endings. This is why we need fictions of what <em>might happen</em> in the future. And we also need more objective information, to judge the likelihood of these different scenarios. Here, uncertainty may perhaps feel uncomfortable, but it is necessary.<sup id="fnref:uncertainty"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:uncertainty">18</a></sup> <em>Too much</em> certainty about the future can quickly become a problem, an example of the <em>epistemic arrogance</em> pointed out by Taleb. If we become too convinced that a future scenario is what will happen, effectively yielding a prophecy more than a fiction, we may become blinded to other possibilities. Taleb calls this <em>tunneling</em>, and he warns that it causes us to ignore real-world risks and opportunities. For as we have seen, we cannot really predict the future, especially not in the social realm.</p>
<h3>Capturing the future</h3>
<p>Of course our mental scenarios of the future are valuable targets for marketeers, politicians and propagandists, because they strongly influence our plans and our behaviour. Propaganda often aims to sell us a single narrative of what the future will be like. It aims to suppress uncertainty and to vilify competing narratives.<sup id="fnref:identitypolitics"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:identitypolitics">19</a></sup> Decline narratives are especially effective in this regard, for several reasons. One is the negativity effect: Because stories of Decline tap into negative feelings such as fear, they are most effective at grabbing and holding our attention.<sup id="fnref:lossaversion"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:lossaversion">20</a></sup> And when coupled with a feeling of agency (as well as a like-minded social group), Decline narratives can provide a powerful motivation for action. This logic applies on all sides of the political spectrum and in all cultures. Action can involve posting on social media, attending climate protests or anti-immigrant rallies, and voting for or boycotting a political party. Unfortunately it can also involve burning down buildings, murdering people from other ethnic groups, instigating terrorist attacks and igniting all-out warfare. </p>
<p>Part of the problem here is that we are presented with narratives that are too deterministic, and that lack the feeling of an open future in which we have space to act and talk about things. In the case of Decline narratives, the decline is usually presented as imminent, with very little time to prevent it. Whether the threat is climate change or social takeover by some presumed shadow elite or immigrant horde, the need for action tends to be urgent, and the action required radical. The proposed way forward rarely involves a calm debate or working out a compromise between conflicting interests.  <br>
This is not just a problem with stories of Decline, also the narratives of Progress tend to be overdetermined: If it is already <em>certain</em> that science, innovation and technology will save us in the end, why bother trying to fix social or environmental problems through the complicated, messy and slow process of social action and discussion?</p>
<h3>No alternative?</h3>
<p>Another part of the problem is what we might call &ldquo;story poverty&rdquo;. Fritz Breithaupt argues that it&rsquo;s not so much stories we should blame, but rather a lack of alternative storylines: We have too few narratives to choose from when imagining the future. This is very clear when we are asked to imagine better alternatives (or even mere structural changes) to the current Capitalist socio-economic system. The mainstream response for the past half century or so has become so ingrained that it has its own acronym, TINA: <em>There Is No Alternative</em>. Given that this is what most of us believe, one would think that there has been some seriously effective propaganda at work.</p>
<p>In fact, little explicit propaganda was required. What happened was a cultural shift, which the British political scientist <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/people/jonathan-white">Jonathan White</a> calls &ldquo;the privatisation of the future&rdquo;. During the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the Western world increasingly shifted its future focus from the collective to the individual. This was partially a push-back against the more collectivist ideologies of fascism and Communism, and partially driven by the rise of mass-production and consumer marketing in the US. Rather than changing society, which is a long-term collective effort, the dominant goal became to advance ourselves within its structures as individuals, within our own life span. And rather than trying to acquire power (which is always scarce), the personal advancement goals for most of us came to be fulfilled by acquiring objects, experiences and self-improvements. The promise was that we could buy our way into happiness, as long as we were sufficiently enterprising (or lucky). This cultural shift fostered a sense of competition. It also made us increasingly skeptical of ideology and collective organisation toward common goals, especially if these involve long-term projects that surpass our own lifetime. This in turn transformed our institutions: citizens today are regarded mostly as consumers and voters, in a world of short-term personal choices rather than substantive collective ones. This shift toward a privatised future eventually happened globally. It has made it very difficult to imagine an alternative society, one that does not revolve around fulfilling our immediate personal goals through consumption. </p>
<p>Of course, even if we are focused on our personal lives, we still have hopes and fears when it comes to our collective future. This is evident from our shared stories of Progress and Decline, as well as our mass-consumption of future-oriented fiction in the form of books, movies and series. The problem is that we are mostly passive in the face of these possible futures. We are too busy with our personal goals and too focused on choices that mostly revolve around work or consumption. The agency we have for shaping our common future feels limited to voting every few years and choosing which things to buy or which to avoid. It feels as if we are free to choose our personal future but not our collective future. The latter seems to be determined by all kinds of impersonal structures and forces. It&rsquo;s the Middle Ages all over again, in the sense that we feel unable to challenge the fate of society. It seems destined to either go forward or backward. </p>
<h3>Agency over prophecy</h3>
<p>However, reality is complex and the future is still undetermined. We shouldn&rsquo;t get too hung up on any single description of the future. What we need for dealing with the future <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> prophecy, in the form of a naive, oversimplified or deterministic narrative of what it will be like. Aspects of the future will be better than the past, other aspects will be worse. In the real world outside of simplified stories, our societies and lives oscillate between periods of flourishing and periods of instability. Death is a certainty for individual humans, but societies are remarkably resilient. Empires, governments and institutions may fall apart, cities may be abandoned and economies may crash, but full social collapse is actually very rare. That is good news. Unfortunately the bad news is that endless Progress is even less likely.<sup id="fnref:ancientcycles"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ancientcycles">21</a></sup> </p>
<p>One of the main reasons why we cannot predict social systems very well, is that at any point we <em>do</em> have agency. You can act to change the future, and so can other people, for better or for worse. The social future is always still open and we cannot say what it will be like, only what we strive for, and what we fear for. Collectively, humans can do incredible things, or terrible and stupid things. But crucially, we have choices, which brings us to the subject of hope.</p>
<h3>Rediscovering possibility</h3>
<p>Hope, as I use the term here, isn&rsquo;t the same as optimism, wishful thinking or faith. Optimism and pessimism say something about the expectations we have. The same is true for faith or wishful thinking, which entail the expectation that all will be well, eventually. Holding positive or negative expectations about the future or about people is a mental strategy we use to <em>reduce uncertainty</em>. This can be a good thing, but unfortunately these strategies can also blind us to reality.  <br>
Hope is different, it is based on the sense that things may perhaps be bad, but they <em>could</em> get better. Hope requires us to acknowledge that the future is uncertain, but also that, in principle, we can <em>act</em> to change it. Hope is an active stance, and it requires a sense of agency and possibility. It is the opposite of <em>hopelessness</em>, the feeling that there is no way to change a bad situation. And according to the psychologist <a href="https://www.jamil-zaki.com">Jamil Zaki</a>, the enemy of hope is <em>cynicism</em>, a conviction that other people generally have bad intentions. To a cynic, there is no point in trying to change the world for the better, because most people are out for themselves and thus have no interest in working toward a better future for others.</p>
<p>Indeed, history shows plenty of violence, suppression, corruption and failed attempts at creating a better society. But history also shows that people <em>can</em> and <em>do</em> act against their own narrow interests, and that we <em>can</em> collectively act to improve the wellbeing of most people&mdash;this is precisely the point of the narrative of Progress, at least in its active form. History as we commonly experience it, is a story put together from elements that we select from the past. We can use it to feed hope or to feed cynicism.</p>
<p>Our dominant narratives of Progress and Decline have a tendency to downplay human agency. They present an image of societies that are pushed around by big forces that we common people cannot really control. For instance, economic growth and AI will either push our society forward, or they will destroy it. Such stories can easily justify cynicism and inaction. They serve to uphold the status quo, at least when it comes to the structure of society: If there is not much we can do to, say, reduce inequality, why bother trying to change anything?   <br>
The alternative to such a cynical and passive view is to focus on Hope. To say: We don&rsquo;t know how things will turn out, they may get worse but they <em>could</em> also improve. Therefore, we need to work together with others toward solving problems, to increase the probability that things may get better. This, in turn, requires that we formulate shared goals, and a set of shared values that underlie these goals.</p>
<h3>The danger of ideology</h3>
<p>Conservative thinkers tend to be very weary of collective action, especially if it is driven by some impersonal, Utopian ideology. Hitler&rsquo;s National Socialism or Stalin&rsquo;s version of Communism are often cited as examples of the misery and destruction that may result if we give in to the &ldquo;tyranny of the crowd&rdquo;. Indeed, these ideologies were driven by overconfident, deterministic and ultimately unrealistic visions of the future, and they should <em>certainly</em> serve as cautionary examples. We should moreover distrust any ideology that prioritises <em>beliefs</em> over values, or that pushes for values that are not universal. Shared values should be ones that are <em>actually</em> shared by most people, not just a select group. Most people will agree for instance that the values underlying &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; are important, even if their actions or political viewpoints may not always reflect this (because humans are rarely consistent). We may not wish it upon those we consider our &ldquo;enemies&rdquo;, but I would bet very few of us would oppose human wellbeing <em>in principle</em>, or even wellbeing for other living beings.</p>
<h3>Components of Hope</h3>
<p>If we choose to focus on Hope, deterministic narratives of Progress or Decline lose much of their power. They are no longer seen as inevitable outcomes, although they remain useful as possible scenarios for mental simulation. They can still provide us with motivation to act, or serve to warn us about problems that <em>may</em> occur in our future.    <br>
Hope means acting, toward shaping a future that we want, while recognising that there might be difficulties, setbacks and failures. Hope in this sense requires both a feeling of agency and a form of determination, a motivational driving force to keep us going. Faith or optimism can certainly help, although positive expectations are by no means required. What effective Hope <em>does</em> require is a degree of <em>epistemic humility</em>. This means that we should be skeptical of our own beliefs and expectations, <em>especially</em> when it comes to predicting the future or guessing the intentions of other people.  </p>
<p>Successful collective action requires at least two ingredients. The first is a shared motivational force, which is usually provided by &ldquo;righteous anger&rdquo; at some moral issue. The second ingredient is <em>efficacy</em>, the feeling that we can do something about the moral issue in question. This is how social change happens, it is the motor behind our moral progress in the past.<sup id="fnref:moralregression"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:moralregression">22</a></sup>   <br>
Mostly it is not the case that one person can make a difference in the face of collective systemic problems. But history has shown that a large number of determined people can certainly make a difference, if they organize themselves. And in such collective efforts, individuals <em>can</em> make a difference, because actual people do have to do the organising.</p>
<h3>Beyond wishful thinking</h3>
<p>We cannot take individual responsibility for solving collective problems. Such problems are simply too big, and too much entwined with power relations, economic interests, historic institutions and other social structures. The suggestion that we can solve complex structural problems by simply <em>buying the right products</em> is ludicrous. And the idea that technology <em>by itself</em> can solve such problems for us is similarly unrealistic. There is nothing wrong in principle with technological solutions, but they need to acknowledge complexity and uncertainty. And they should be embedded in shared goals, cooperative behavior and structural social and economic change, rather than wishful thinking.   <br>
The problem isn&rsquo;t that we have too few solutions, technological or otherwise. The problem is that our current social and economic structures prevent issues like inequality or long-term sustainability from being addressed in the first place, or even from being recognised as problems by many. And unfortunately, changing established economic and social structures for the better is neither easy nor fast. It requires sustained collective effort, often over multiple generations. It also requires discussion, compromise and collective learning, as well as institutional structures that can facilitate this.</p>
<p>The future is a fiction, a mental simulation that we cannot really count on. But we <em>can</em> try to play our part in shaping it, together with other people. The narratives we share about possible futures play an important role in this. They may not be prophecies, but they do coordinate our expectations and our sense of possibility. And expectations matter, because they determine our actions, or the lack thereof.</p>
<h3>Social complexity</h3>
<p>Our current-day society isn&rsquo;t short of stories about the future, both positive and negative. But we lack <em>realistic</em> stories, grounded in a humility about our knowledge of the future and a realisation that we live in a complex world, which is shaped by the collective action of billions of human beings. This complex social world is coordinated to a large extent by shared narratives and is held together by a network of institutions. Both these narratives and these institutions are far from perfect, but they can, in principle, be improved. To do this successfully requires <em>not</em> a Revolution but, instead, a process of collective learning. This process is greatly aided by a hopeful and cooperative mindset: It helps to be skeptical toward unsupported assumptions, and to be open to discussion, compromise and cooperation in general. Hope works best in a supportive and cooperative social context, while it is difficult in a world composed of competing individuals. Hope is borne out of a sense of connectedness to others. And moral commitment is fostered when we can <em>share</em> important goals. </p>
<p>If all this sounds perhaps too easy, it is because cooperation is, in fact, far from easy. Successful cooperation is <em>hard</em>, especially if large groups of people are involved. But as we shall see in the next article, the success of humans is based precisely on overcoming the obstacles to cooperation. Working together may be hard, but that is no reason to give up on it. Humans absolutely <em>require</em> cooperation. And it may not always seem this way, but compared to most other species, we are exceptionally good at it.</p>

Considered by some to be among the most influential books since World War II, <em>The Black Swan</em> investigates the profound impact of unpredictable events. The book highlights a fundamental human blindness to randomness, asserting that our minds are &ldquo;explanation machines&rdquo; that use narrative fallacies to create a coherent, but false, sense of understanding the past. We generally think of the world as a place that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb">Taleb</a> calls &ldquo;Mediocristan&rdquo;, where individual events are inconsequential to the total. However, much of our world actually belongs to a different realm he has named &ldquo;Extremistan&rdquo;, where single events can disproportionately dominate outcomes. This renders standard statistical tools like the bell curve dangerously inadequate for describing the future as well as the past. History, according to Taleb, is disproportionately driven by &ldquo;Black Swans&rdquo;, rare and unpredictable but very consequential events or trends. Rather than naively attempting to forecast the future using limited past data, we should focus on what we do <em>not</em> know—and build robustness against negative Black Swans, while maximising our benefit from positive ones. This forms the basis of a strategy that Taleb calls &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility">antifragility</a>&rdquo;) in later work.   <br>
<em>The Black Swan</em> forms the second part of <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/INO/incerto/">The Incerto</a></em>, Taleb&rsquo;s philosophical investigation into the nature of uncertainty, the (mostly inadequate) ways in which we currently deal with it, and how we can do better.

Taleb et al. formalise the precautionary principle as a rigorous statistical tool for preventing systemic ruin in cases where potential harm is irreversible and scientific knowledge is incomplete. The paper asserts that for policies carrying a risk of global catastrophe—such as human extinction—the burden of proof regarding safety must fall on those proposing the action, as the integrated cost of ruin is effectively infinite and cannot be balanced against finite potential benefits. fat-tailed distributions and global connectivity allow single outlier events or &ldquo;Black Swans&rdquo; to propagate into total failure. Central to this framework is a fragility-based approach identifying how systems respond non-linearly to harm; because repeated exposure to even tiny risks of ruin leads to a mathematical certainty of destruction over time, systemic threats must be treated as if they were inevitable. Consequently, the work argues that Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) should be severely restricted due to their top-down, systemic impact on the biosphere, whereas the risks of nuclear energy are more localized and well-characterised, making them suitable for standard risk management rather than the precautionary principle. Ultimately, the paper advocates for policy via negativa, suggesting that rather than introducing complex interventions that induce unforeseen side effects, safety should be sought by removing fragilizing dependencies and restoring boundaries that inhibit the global propagation of shocks.</p>

Breithaupt explores how humans have developed narrative thinking to transform individual perceptions into shared experiences. The work posits that our minds possess a unique ‘mobility of consciousness’, which allows us to mentally transport ourselves into different situations to co-experience the worlds of others. Narrative thinking is structured into emotion episodes where engagement is motivated and rewarded by specific emotions—such as triumph, wonder, or satisfaction—at the episode’s conclusion, providing a signal to the brain that the sequence is complete. This process is further defined by ‘multiversionality’, the ability to simultaneously contemplate multiple contradictory versions of a story, which not only creates suspense in fiction, but also helps us overcome crises and prevents us from being trapped by singular, rigid identities in real life.</p>
<p>Jonathan White. <em><a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/in-the-long-run">In the Long Run</a>: The Future as a Political Idea</em>. Profile Books, 2024.   <br>
This book is discusses the future as a political idea. White traces the 18<sup>th</sup>-century emergence of an &ldquo;open future&rdquo;—the belief that history is susceptible to human influence. This galvanised mass political participation and the development of ideologies like socialism and liberalism. However, White argues that we have transitioned into a volatile &ldquo;age of emergencies&rdquo;, which foster a sense of &ldquo;temporal claustrophobia&rdquo; where time appears to be running out. This perceived urgency often marginalises democratic processes in favour of either an authoritarian approach or a managerial, calculative outlook managed by experts. The decline of traditional mass political parties has traded long-term collective projects for short-termist, personalised projects, in a process that White calls the &ldquo;privitisation of the future&rdquo;. Ultimately, democracy depends on an expectation of continuation; to survive, it must move beyond an obsession with imminent endings to recapture a sense of temporal depth in which we can collectively work on our shared future. Moreover, resolving collective problems requires debate and compromises, and democratic institutions are required to mediate this process. Contemporary democratic institutions are far from perfect, but this does not mean that we should get rid of them in favour of non-democratic decision making. Rather, it means that democratic institutions need to be strengthened and improved. One proposal for &hellip; </p>

This book is a sociological analysis of decision making in modern capitalist economies. It&rsquo;s core hypothesis is that history matters, but the future matters just as much. The problem is of course that the future is unknowable, especially in our modern complex and dynamic economies. The past is of little use here as a guide. Yet many of our actions are future-oriented and thus cannot be conducted without any assumptions about the future. In practice, this problem is solved by acting on “fictional expectations”, imagined scenarios of what the future will be like. These fictional expectations are produced by expert opinions, theoretical models and various kinds of forecasts. Economic and technological forecasts are rarely accurate, but Beckert argues that accuracy is not their main function. Forecasts mostly need to be <em>convincing</em>: what matters is the momentary <em>belief</em> in accuracy. Forecasts help actors make sense of seemingly chaotic or incomprehensibly complex situations, and give them the confidence to make and justify decisions. Capitalism needs fictional expectations in order to operate, they help economic actors work in concert in the face of uncertainty. Though the future cannot be known, it is possible to know what other people think about it. If many people share a conviction that the future will develop in a specific way, they end up behaving in foreseeable ways and their actions become coordinated to some degree. Positive imagined futures can drive economic growth, and bleak ones can trigger economic crises. By continuously telling stories about the future toward which they are headed, economic actors effectively help <em>create</em> the future.    <br>
<a href="https://www.mpifg.de/beckert_en">Jens Beckert</a> also discusses some of these ideas in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FseT_EU-EbI">2019 talk</a> at the Watson School of International and Public Affairs.</p>
<p>Jamil Zaki. <em><a href="https://www.jamil-zaki.com/hope-for-cynics">Hope for Cynics</a>: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness</em>. Grand Central Publishing, 2024.   <br>
Zaki’s book characterises cynicism as a pervasive &ldquo;disease of social health&rdquo; rooted in the mistaken theory that humanity is inherently selfish, greedy, and dishonest,. He deconstructs the &ldquo;cynical genius illusion&rdquo;—the false belief that mistrust is a sign of superior intelligence—by citing research showing that cynics actually perform worse on cognitive tests and are less effective at spotting liars than their trusting counterparts. The book explains how cynicism functions as a self-fulfilling prophecy, where &ldquo;preemptive strikes&rdquo; of mistrust provoke the very selfishness they fear, whereas &ldquo;leaps of faith&rdquo; and a &ldquo;reciprocity mindset&rdquo; can transform social interactions into virtuous cycles. To counter this, Zaki advocates for &ldquo;hopeful skepticism&rdquo;, a mindset that replaces knee-jerk mistrust with a curiosity-driven commitment to data, noting that most people consistently underestimate the altruism and trustworthiness of others. By examining how inequality and elite abuse foster anomie, the work calls for &ldquo;asset-framing&rdquo; and local community-building to restore the &ldquo;psychological glue&rdquo; of trust, ultimately arguing that hope is not a naive evasion of reality but a practical tool for effective activism and collective progress.</p>

The late Jane Goodall characterises hope not as passive wishful thinking but as a crucial survival trait that demands active engagement and hard work. Presented as a series of dialogues, the book identifies four pillars of hope: the amazing human intellect, the resilience of nature, the power of young people, and the indomitable human spirit. Goodall argues that the same intellect that created environmental crises, when coupled with our unique mastery of language, is capable of devising the creative solutions needed to heal the Earth. She illustrates nature’s capacity for restoration through stories of &ldquo;survivor trees&rdquo; and species brought back from the brink of extinction, asserting that life possesses an innate will to live and adapt. Furthermore, the work emphasises the importance of empowering the next generation through programmes like Roots &amp; Shoots, which foster the agency and purpose required to tackle global challenges. Ultimately, Goodall maintains that while the window for change is narrowing, the cumulative effect of individual ethical actions can still create a sustainable future.</p>
<p>C. Richard Snyder (editor). <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-654050-5.X5000-3">Handbook of Hope</a>: Theory, Measures, and Applications</em>. Elsevier Science, 2000.   <br>
Richard Snyder. <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/psychologyofhope00snyd">The Psychology of Hope</a>: You Can Get There from Here</em>. Simon and Schuster, 1994.   <br>
Paraphrased from Wikipedia: Snyder writes that hope is cultivated when we have a goal in mind, determination that a goal can be reached, and a plan on how to reach those goals. He postulates that three main things make up hopeful thinking: Goals (approaching life in a goal-oriented way), pathways (finding different ways to achieve your goals) and agency (believing that you can instigate change and achieve these goals). In other words, hope is defined here as the perceived capability to derive pathways to desired goals and motivate oneself via agency thinking to use those pathways. Snyder argues that individuals who are able to realize these three components and develop a belief in their ability are hopeful people who can establish clear goals, imagine multiple workable pathways toward those goals, and persevere, even when obstacles get in their way. Snyder also stresses the link between hope and mental willpower (hardiness), as well as the need for realistic perception of goals (problem orientation), arguing that the difference between hope and optimism was that the former can look like wishful thinking but the latter provides the energy to find practical pathways for an improved future.</p>
<p>Daniel Kahneman. <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></em>. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011.   <br>
Kahneman&rsquo;s work forms an important basis for examining the limitations of human reason and the fallibility of expert systems and policies. Where Nassim Nicholas Taleb introduces the concept of <em>epistemic arrogance</em> to signify that we overestimate our knowledge in the face of a volatile future, Kahneman identifies and describes the cognitive biases and mental shortcuts that lead individuals to overconfidence. He shows how our brains frequently prefer coherent narratives over complex truths.   <br>
Kahneman characterises the optimistic bias as a pervasive tendency to perceive the world as more benign, one’s own attributes as more favourable, and one’s goals as more achievable than is realistically the case. He labels it the &ldquo;engine of capitalism&rdquo;, noting that it is particularly prevalent among inventors, entrepreneurs, and leaders who play a disproportionate role in shaping society through their willingness to seek challenges and take risks. This bias is primarily driven by System 1 thinking and the WYSIATI (what you see is all there is) rule, which leads individuals to focus on their specific plans while neglecting base rates, competitor skills, and the role of luck. A key manifestation is the planning fallacy, where project forecasts are unrealistically close to best-case scenarios because people fail to adopt an &ldquo;outside view&rdquo; based on the statistics of similar past cases. While optimism provides critical resilience and is often essential for scientific success, it also fosters a dangerous collective blindness to risk and uncertainty. To mitigate these effects, Kahneman advocates for the &ldquo;premortem&rdquo;, a technique where teams imagine a project has failed and reconstruct the history of that disaster to identify neglected threats.</p>
<p>Tali Sharot. <em><a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/tali_sharot">The Science of Optimism</a>: Why We’re Hard-Wired for Hope</em>. Ted Conferences, 2012.   <br>
In this short book that accompanies her TED-talk, Sharot investigates the <em>optimism bias</em>, a pervasive human tendency to overestimate the likelihood of positive future events while underestimating negative risks,. This bias is hard-wired into the brain by evolution as a critical survival mechanism, facilitating mental time travel—the ability to envision and plan for a better future. The book explains that this rosy outlook persists because the brain selectively incorporates desirable information, while often discounting bad news. While this mindset fosters resilience, improved health, and professional achievement, Sharot cautions that it can also trigger disastrous miscalculations, such as financial bubbles or the neglect of health checkups. Ultimately, the work highlights that while optimism varies across the lifespan—with children and the elderly showing higher bias than middle-aged adults—it remains a global phenomenon essential for human progress.</p>

This work explores the &ldquo;negativity effect&rdquo;—the fundamental psychological principle that bad is stronger than good, meaning negative events and emotions affect humans more profoundly than positive ones. This bias was an evolutionary adaptation essential for survival on the ancestral savanna, where the cost of ignoring a predator or poisonous berry far outweighed the benefit of savoring a tasty meal. Central to their thesis is the &ldquo;Rule of Four,&rdquo; a practical guideline suggesting that it typically requires four positive experiences to offset the lingering impact of a single negative one. The authors argue that in relationships, business, and parenting, avoiding basic mistakes is more critical than striving for perfection, and they advocate for the &ldquo;Negative Golden Rule&rdquo;—focusing on what one does not do to others to maintain social harmony. They critique modern &ldquo;merchants of bad&rdquo; who exploit this bias through fearmongering and offer strategies for a &ldquo;low-bad diet&rdquo; of information, alongside techniques to engage the rational brain against irrational impulses. Ultimately, the work asserts that while bad is immediately more potent, good can prevail through persistence and a conscious effort to leverage bad feelings as incentives for improvement.
Note that near the end of the book, the authors seem to assume that the precautionary principle is unwarranted because precaution in the face of new technologies rests on fears inspired by our negativity bias. They seem either unaware of or unwilling to consider the discussion of actual societal risks under future uncertainty, e.g. as discussed by Taleb et al. </p>

The Bright Side characterises optimism not as a naive belief, but as a pragmatic resource and a &ldquo;sturdy determination&rdquo; necessary for navigating life’s most difficult reckonings. Spurred by the personal tragedy of his wife’s death, the author investigates how optimism functions as a biological motivator—illustrated by the &ldquo;frog in the milk&rdquo; parable—that drives humans and animals to act when outcomes are uncertain, thereby avoiding self-fulfilling &ldquo;pessimism traps&rdquo;. Structured according to Helen Keller’s 1903 structure, the book explores &ldquo;Optimism Within&rdquo; (the neurobiology of the optimism bias and positive illusions), &ldquo;Optimism Without&rdquo; (the rational basis for progress), and &ldquo;Optimism in the World&rdquo; (our power to anticipate and improve the future). Paul-Choudhury advocates for a shift from passive Panglossianism to a Leibnizian aspiration, where &ldquo;the best of all possible worlds&rdquo; is treated as an objective to be realised through the active exploration of possible-worlds thinking and scenarios. Ultimately, the work defines 21<sup>st</sup>-century optimism through the philosophy of meliorism, asserting that it is a &ldquo;shared duty&rdquo; and a form of true moral courage essential for solving collective global challenges like climate change.</p>

This amusing but highly useful book investigates the deathless appeal of stories about the end of the world, exploring how existential dread interacts with fiction, politics, science, and the public mood. He distinguishes between religious eschatology, which focuses on divine judgment and transformation, and secular eschatology, which encompasses planetary demolition, human extinction, and the collapse of civilisation. Lynskey maps an &ldquo;inexhaustible stockpile&rdquo; of doomsday scenarios, ranging from comet impacts and nuclear winter to rogue artificial intelligence and pandemic-induced social breakdown. The work examines how modern humanity has transitioned from viewing the end as a distant, natural inevitability to a potential anthropogenic &ldquo;omnicide&rdquo; currently prioritised by &ldquo;longtermist&rdquo; philosophers. Lynskey critiques the numbing effect of &ldquo;apocalyptic overload&rdquo; and warns against the defeatism of &ldquo;doomerism,&rdquo; arguing that narratives of the end should function as &ldquo;jeremiads&rdquo; intended to inspire prophylactic action rather than psychological surrender. He ultimately concludes that even in the face of possible termination, the &ldquo;greatest possible victory&rdquo; is the continued success of having existed and experienced life within an indifferent universe.</p>
<p>Arthur Herman. <em><a href="https://www.arthur-herman.com/book/the-idea-of-decline-in-western-history">The Idea of Decline in Western History</a></em>. Simon and Schuster, 1997.   <br>
This work examines the idea of decline in Western history and sets out to explain how the conviction of civilization&rsquo;s inevitable end has become a fixed part of the modern Western imagination. Through a series of biographical portraits spanning the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, the author traces the roots of declinism and aims to show how major thinkers of the past and present, including Nietzsche, DuBois, Sartre, and Foucault, have contributed to its development as a coherent ideology of cultural pessimism.   <br>
Herman investigates the origins and diffusion of the intellectual tradition that perceives modern society as being in a state of terminal deterioration. The work distinguishes between historical pessimism, characterised by a fearful desire to preserve a society under threat, and cultural pessimism, a more radical stance that anticipates or even welcomes civilisational collapse as a necessary prerequisite for a new, redemptive order. Herman traces how this &ldquo;dark underside&rdquo; of modern thought evolved from 19<sup>th</sup>-century Romanticism and racial theories into a dominant theme within 20<sup>th</sup>-century politics, influencing diverse figures from Friedrich Nietzsche and Oswald Spengler to the Frankfurt School. A central paradox identified by the author is that cultural pessimists often view catastrophic events with &ldquo;barely concealed glee&rdquo;, as they believe the destruction of &ldquo;sick&rdquo; Western culture will clear the way for a totally non-Western future. Ultimately, the book argues that the idea of decline is the &ldquo;reverse image&rdquo; of the idea of progress; both frameworks rely on the flawed holistic assumption that societies are singular organisms governed by inexorable historical laws. Herman concludes that this pervasive &ldquo;pop pessimism&rdquo; continues to shape contemporary discourse through movements such as multiculturalism and eco-pessimism, which often systematically deprecate the material and social successes of modern Western life.</p>
<p>Robert Nisbet. <em><a href="https://www.routledge.com/History-of-the-Idea-of-Progress/Nisbet/p/book/9781560007135">History of the Idea of Progress</a></em>. Routledge, 2017.   <br>
Nisbet argues that the belief in humanity’s continuous advancement is rooted in the fusion of ancient Greek philosophies of growth and Jewish concepts of historical necessity. This synthesis was refined by St. Augustine, who established a linear narrative of the &ldquo;education of the human race,&rdquo; viewing history as a series of necessary, cumulative stages leading toward a final, redemptive state. He also states that modern progressivism merely secularised divine Providence into &ldquo;natural laws&rdquo; or scientific &ldquo;entelechies,&rdquo; yet it retained the holistic assumption that societies function as organisms with predictable life cycles. This framework directly informs Arthur Herman’s analysis, as Nisbet argues that progress and decline are &ldquo;opposite sides of the same coin,&rdquo; both depending on the same deterministic logic to forecast either civilisational triumph or terminal decay. While Dorian Lynskey examines secular eschatology as a contemporary &ldquo;vibe&rdquo; of finality, Nisbet traces these doomsday narratives back to Christian millennialism, asserting that the Western expectation of a &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; on earth originally required a period of apocalyptic conflict and purging to usher in the new order. Ultimately, Nisbet concludes that the erosion of the intellectual premises that supported this narrative—such as faith in reason and respect for the past—has resulted in a modern &ldquo;failure of nerve&rdquo; and a terminal &ldquo;disowning of the past&rdquo;.</p>

Fisher introduces the concept of Capitalist Realism, the widespread sense that free market capitalism is the only viable political and economic system and that a coherent alternative is impossible to even imagine. Drawing on the phrase that it is &ldquo;easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism,&rdquo; Fisher describes a worldview in which it is considered obvious that everything in society, from healthcare to education, should be run as a business. The book explores how capitalist culture has even managed to pre-emptively format our desires and hopes, turning even rebellion into a marketable style. Fisher identifies a pervasive condition of &ldquo;reflexive impotence&rdquo; among the public—a knowledge that the system is dysfunctional coupled with the belief that nothing can be done about it. But rather than seeing this as a systemic problem, the resulting distress is privatised and treated as an individual pathology.</p>

<a href="https://hajoonchang.net">Ha-Joon Chang</a> is an advocate of capitalism (&ldquo;To paraphrase Winston Churchill, I think it&rsquo;s the worst economic system except for all the others.&rdquo;) but criticises extreme free market capitalism in his book 23 Things They Don&rsquo;t Tell You About Capitalism.
Chang points out that the technologies that had the most influence are not the ones we usually think of, but rather more mundane ones like the washing machine (and the shipping container). Of course it&rsquo;s not just the washing machine, it&rsquo;s piped water, electricity, irons and so on, which allowed women to leave the home and join the workforce, nearly doubling the potential workforce.
Technology can have huge impacts. 
The invention of the printing press was one of the most important events in human history. 
Before the invention of the telegraph in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, it took two to three weeks to carry a message across the Atlantic. The telegraph reduced it to 20 or 30 minutes – an increase of 2,000-3,000 times.
But we overestimate the internet and ignore its downsides. There&rsquo;s now so much information out there that you don&rsquo;t actually have time to digest it. Herbert Simon argued that our problem now is that we have limited decision-making capability rather than too little information. If you try to find something on the internet, it&rsquo;s a deluge. </p>

A nice perspective on why AI is probably a hype.
Media and public discourse are saturated with extreme, unsupported claims about AI’s transformative power.
Examples: Publications like The New York Times uncritically promote AI utopianism or doom
People are frustrated with modern life and gradual change and seek revolutionary solutions.
Solipsism of Consciousness: Humans naturally believe they live in a uniquely important time, fueling millenarian thinking.
Every era has had groups convinced of an imminent, world-changing event (religious, political, technological).
AI as Modern Eschatology: The belief in AI’s epoch-making power mirrors past movements, often driven by frustration and a desire for deliverance.
Truly transformative technologies (automobiles, electrification, medicine) visibly reshaped daily life—AI has not yet done so.
Current Reality: AI’s tangible impact (e.g., chatbots, spam) pales next to past technological revolutions.
Daily life in 2025 is remarkably similar to 2015; incremental tech updates (phones, laptops) fail to inspire.
Millennial Nostalgia: Longing for Obama-era techno-optimism, when new gadgets felt more exciting.
AI hype reflects a wish to escape mundane realities (student loans, traffic, aging, death).
Unmet Promises: AI fails to address daily frustrations (municipal services, health, mortality).
The world remains ordinary, and AI won’t change that—people must find meaning in the life they have.</p>
<p>Peter Turchin. <em><a href="https://peterturchin.com/book/end-times">End Times</a>: Elites, Counter-Elites, and the Path of Political Disintegration</em>. Penguin Publishing Group, 2023.   <br>
Turchin shows (based on empirical data) how there are patterns to history, driven by common social mechanisms. Social systems are broadly predictable in some of their large-scale dynamics, because periods of growth and decline these depend on stability, which in turn is linked to successful coordination, trust, conflict within or between elites (power holders) and popular emiseration. He also shows through case studies that each historical case is unique.
Turchin and collegues employ cliodynamics—the mathematical study of historical change—to argue that complex societies are driven toward state breakdown by predictable waves of political instability. He identifies a perverse &ldquo;wealth pump&rdquo; as the primary engine of discord; this mechanism transfers economic rewards from the working class to a small elite, resulting in popular immiseration—characterised by stagnating wages and declining life expectancy—and elite overproduction. This overproduction creates a surplus of frustrated elite aspirants who, finding no room in the upper echelons of power, become counter-elites that organise mass discontent to challenge the established order. Turchin frames the rise of Donald Trump and the &ldquo;Turbulent Twenties&rdquo; not as isolated events but as manifestations of these impersonal social forces, which his models previously indicated would trigger a peak of political violence around 2020. Drawing on thousands of years of data in CrisisDB, he illustrates that history cycles between integrative and disintegrative phases, with the latter typically ending in revolution or civil war. Ultimately, the work asserts that while catastrophe is common, &ldquo;success stories&rdquo; like the American Progressive Era and Chartist-period Britain prove that elites can avoid total collapse by shutting down the wealth pump and enacting reforms that rebalance the social system.</p>
<p>Richard G. Olson. <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BFzpCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR5&amp;ots=MHNyDci-Wa&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage">Scientism and Technocracy in the Twentieth Century</a>: The Legacy of Scientific Management</em>. Lexington Books, 2015.    <br>
Olson traces the rise of scientific management and technocracy, documenting how the drive for industrial efficiency shaped global policy and labour relations throughout the twentieth century. This has created an illusion of control, maintained by specialists who rely on rigid mathematical models or structured systems.   <br>
This book explores how the importation of scientific attitudes and methods into social and political domains—defined as scientism—came to dominate global governance and industry. Olson identifies Frederick Winslow Taylor’s Scientific Management as the critical node from which these ideologies spread, moving beyond the factory floor to shape public administration, the arts through Modernism, and diverse political systems ranging from capitalist democracies to socialist and fascist regimes. The work characterises the &ldquo;technocratic mentality&rdquo; by its confidence in scientific problem-solving, its distrust of traditional politics, and its commitment to material productivity and efficiency over considerations of distributive justice or democratic equality.     </p>
<p>Jared Diamond. <em><a href="http://www.jareddiamond.org/Jared_Diamond/Collapse.html">Collapse</a>: How Societies Choose to Fail Or Succeed</em>. Viking, 2005.   <br>

McAnany and Norman Yoffee (editors). <em><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/universitypress/subjects/archaeology/archaeological-science/questioning-collapse-human-resilience-ecological-vulnerability-and-aftermath-empire">Questioning Collapse</a>: Human Resilience, Ecological Vulnerability, and the Aftermath of Empire</em>. Cambridge University Press, 2010.   <br>
In his influential study &ldquo;Collapse&rdquo;, Diamond argues that past civilisational declines were often driven by &ldquo;ecocide&rdquo;—unintended ecological suicide—where societies inadvertently destroyed the environmental resources upon which they depended. Utilising a five-point framework—encompassing environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbours, loss of trade partners, and a society’s specific response—Diamond concludes that survival is a &ldquo;choice&rdquo; dependent on a culture&rsquo;s capacity for long-term planning and its willingness to jettison maladaptive core values. In contrast, McAnany and Yoffee’s Questioning Collapse deconstructs this thesis, asserting that human resilience and regeneration, rather than absolute, apocalyptic failure, are the true leitmotifs of history. The critics reframe &ldquo;abandonments&rdquo; not as failures but as flexible mobility strategies used by indigenous peoples to survive environmental or political crises. Furthermore, they argue that Diamond’s &ldquo;ecocide&rdquo; narratives—particularly regarding Easter Island—ignore the more documented impacts of colonial genocide and disease, while his focus on &ldquo;choice&rdquo; overlooks the uneven power structures and historical legacies of imperialism that constrain human agency. Ultimately, while Diamond presents the past as a series of stark environmental lessons for modern survival, McAnany and Yoffee suggest that his geographic determinism obscures the complex cultural and political contexts that allow societies to endure through change.</p>
<p>Paul Cooper. <em><a href="https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/fall-of-civilizations-the-book">Fall of Civilizations</a>: Stories of Greatness and Decline</em>. Duckworth, 2024.   <br>
Based on his popular and extremely well-researched podcast Fall of Civilizations, Cooper characterises civilisations as large, organised societies and focuses on historical episodes where the social fabric disintegrated, leading to the significant abandonment of population centres. Success and persistence typically stem from ingenious resource management—such as the Khmer’s complex water networks—strategic trade interdependencies, and the religious or divine status of rulers. Cooper argues that eventual decline often occurs when these once-nurturing productive forces turn into liabilities and the society proves unable or unwilling to change course. This collapse is frequently driven by a &ldquo;perfect storm of calamities&rdquo;, including unforeseen climate shifts like megadroughts, wanton environmental degradation, and staggering levels of inequality that destroy social cohesion and the ability to react to crises. Additionally, the disintegration of exchange systems and bellicose treatment of neighbours can accelerate the unravelling of empires, leaving behind ruins that serve as warnings against the greed and short-sightedness of contemporary global systems.</p>

It has also been attributed to the American baseball player Yogi Berra (e.g. by Nassim Nicholas Taleb), again without much evidence (Taleb acknowledges this, but cites Yogi Berra anyway, in part because he likes him).

<li id="fn:mentalsimulation">
<p>Mental simulation comes natural to us, we don’t just use it to imagine the future or counterfactual scenarios, but also for constructing the past. Even our experience of the present isn’t generally based on observation of “what is”, but is to a large extent based on memory and simulation. We don’t experience what is there, but what we expect to be there.
Talk about the default mode network, (day)dreaming
People process a story by experiencing it (mental simulation), and then they transmit these experiences when retelling a story. This is why emotion is so important in narrative, it is an important part of the experience of story.
Mobility of consciousness allows us to put ourselves mentally in different places and situations
We use this ability every time we read a text, so it is easy to demonstrate.
Consider the following story, which is only one sentence and has a very minimal plot (describing cause and effect): <em>Laura kicks the ball, the ball goes into the goal.</em>
Upon reading this minimalist narrative, most people will (visually or otherwise) imagine a scene with someone kicking a ball. Aspects of this scene will be drawn from memory, because it is likely that you have observed similar scenes in reality (or on television, or in pictures). 
We can also imagine scenes for events that have not happened because they are completely fictional, such as in the following narrative: <em>Laura shoots the alien out of the sky.</em> It is unlikely that you will have experienced such an event yourself, but still you can mentally simulate it (probably aided by the various movies and illustrations you have been exposed to in the past).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:mentalsimulation" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:defaultmode">
<p>Following Sources:Podcasts etc.:The Great Simplification:Taylor Guthrie, say something about the default mode network, and the fact that we automatically tend to &ldquo;drift off&rdquo; and think about the past and the future when we&rsquo;re not busy doing anything else. This is also why it&rsquo;s hard to be &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo;. This can be a bad thing, and we can train ourselves to suppress the default mode network through meditation, which is a very useful and beneficial skill. But we should realise that this default mode activity is also powerful and important, not just for planning and learning, but also for value integration (what do we consider good and bad) and for building a stable identity (what kind of person am I?).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:defaultmode" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:apocalypse">
<p>There are different variations on the Decline narrative, and distinguishing between them may be useful. Notably, apocalyptic narratives are a class of stories that roughly follow the template of the biblical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation">Book of Revelation</a> (although the genre predates this text). In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_literature">apocalyptic</a> narratives, things must first get worse before they can get better. The end cannot and should not be averted, because it is needed to punish and get rid of evildoers. After this Apocalypse, some kind of perfect Utopia can be established for the chosen people.    <br>
The historical popularity of Revelations and other apocalyptic stories attest to our need for narrative structure and the expectation of an ending, as described by Fritz Breithaupt in his book <em><a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300273809/the-narrative-brain">The Narrative Brain</a></em>. Adhering to apocalyptic predictions is a form of <em>presentism</em>, the belief that ours is a special time at the end of history, and that the final crisis will be upon us within our lifetime. It also seems to reflect a wish for the destruction of the old world (with all its failures), to make space for rebirth and the associated expectations of change.   <br>
Note that these quasi-religious narratives are different from <em>alarmist</em> narratives of decline. The latter may also warn of impending doom, but they usually suggest that there is still some time to prevent really bad things from happening. In this case, the &ldquo;apocalypse&rdquo; can and should be averted. While apocalyptic narratives represent problematic and rather passive prophecies, alarmist narratives can be valuable. They may warn us of possible problems and suggest steps to prevent these.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:apocalypse" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:ancientdecline">
<p>Perhaps mention that the decline stories of the ancient Greeks may have been based in part on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prlK8iY7blk">Late Bronze Age collapse</a>, which wiped out much of the surprisingly complex social world of the Eastern Mediterranean around 1300 BC. In general, many ancients myths of social collapse and the destruction of cities and empires were probably based on ancient cultures city states that did exist but that collapsed or were wiped out. Usually such collapse was not due to a single cause, involving for instance a combination of climate change, internal political instability and external military pressure. Name some examples, described in Paul Cooper&rsquo;s <a href="https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com">Fall of Civilizations podcast</a> and book, such as <a href="https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/2019/10/25/episode-8-is-now-live">ancient Sumer</a> and the <a href="https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/2021/06/14/%F0%9F%8C%B4%F0%9F%A6%81episode-13-is-now-live-%F0%9F%A6%81%F0%9F%8C%B4">neo-Assyrian Empire</a>. The eventual destruction of both these empires was at the hands of foreign armies, but they had already been weakened due to other pressures when this happened. Also, these empires existed and were successful for a period much longer than the mere few centuries during which our modern industrial world developed.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ancientdecline" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:innovation">
<p>We like to believe in innovation as a solution for everything, but actually most industries do not like to invest too much in innovation. Tech companies do invest in innovation, although mostly in scaling up and improving existing technology, rarely in developing things that are truly new. Existing companies, especially larger ones, tend to have a business model that work, with existing infrastructure which has already been paid for, while new technologies are expensive their success is uncertain. And the banking and insurance sector base their loan and investment decisions on risk models which are based on existing technologies, and thus they are inherently risk-averse and tend to avoid investing in new, unproven technologies. Investing in true innovation is thus left to government subsidies, volunteers and a small group of green impact investors, all of which are ironically criticised by the same people that believe in tech-solutions and want to leave everything to the market.
Also, there is a lot of potential for true progress in poorer countries using relatively cheap and low-tech innovations, but these are even harder to find funding for, because their return on investment is low while their risk is perceived as high (because the countries are perceived as unstable). See e.g.: https://www.volkskrant.nl/kijkverder/v/2025/investeren-in-afrika~v1288460/
Point out that often technology isn&rsquo;t the main problem. Many problems can be solved just fine, in principle, with existing technology, and sometimes the technology doesn&rsquo;t exist yet but can be developed with a little effort. But in many cases the problem is in coordination, profitability, priorities and conflicting interests. These are arguably the things we should invest in.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:innovation" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:conservative_elite">
<p><em>The problem with thinking of Progress as an active process, a collective fight for social improvement, is that it inherently destabilises societies in their existing form. This makes it unattractive for people who feel they have something to lose.</em>   <br>
Ironically this seemed to include most communist and socialist leaders, who mostly started off fighting for revolution but ended up opposing further changes once they were firmly in power. Rather than yielding a worker&rsquo;s paradise, Communist states mostly evolved into oppressive authoritarian regimes with a small ruling elite. Communist Utopia was usually deferred into the distant future, with the argument that the People weren&rsquo;t ready for it yet. Hence the strong focus of these regimes on technological and economic Progress. Emphasising Progress can shift popular attention away from discontent about the present and create what C. R. Snyder calls a &ldquo;pacifying hope&rdquo; that Progress will cause things to improve in the future. In the peculiar case of China, this was not even a false hope, and things did eventually improve for most people. But one could argue that China is actually more an Empire than a Communist state, and the Chinese empires have always been in it for the long game. Also, Chinese culture has traditionally been focused more on the collective.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:conservative_elite" title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Point out that this is the neoliberal narrative, named for its return to Enlightenment liberalism, and that it isn&rsquo;t all together wrong.

But neoliberal theory also has huge blind spots and itself makes a number of very questionable assumptions about the future and the way social systems function in relation to the physical world. One of these is the idea of technological substitution, others include the assumption that wealth will trickle down and the idea that human wellbeing scales with material wealth and comfort.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:neoliberalism" title="Jump back to footnote 11 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</li>
<li id="fn:progressportrayal">
<p>Mention some ways in which progress tends to be portrayed, like an arrow, or a graph going &ldquo;up and to the right&rdquo;. Such portrayals link our conception of time to the necessity of Progress, and to the fact that orientation in time and place are strongly linked in our mind (they use the same brain circuits). The dominance of technology in our conception of Progress also has to do with the concrete/visible aspects of Progress (machines!), rather than the invisible things (clean drinking water, safe food) or abstract concepts such as knowledge or human rights.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:progressportrayal" title="Jump back to footnote 13 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:exportingdecline">
<p>Sometimes progress in one <em>geographical</em> area depends on decline in another geographical area. The clearest example of this is perhaps European colonialism, and the effects that it has until this day. The initial progress of the industrialised world wasn&rsquo;t conjured out of thin air, it came at the cost of extracting resources and reducing the wellbeing of people in colonies elsewhere. This is not usually an explicit part of the narrative of Progress, even though the success of the Industrial Revolution was enabled to a large extent by the expansive colonialism of Britain and the other European powers. In other words, what was good for Europe was (at least initially) bad for the rest of the world. Europe generated its progress by exporting decline. Moreover, modern industrialised economies still rely on cheap labour and cheap extraction of resources elsewhere.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:exportingdecline" title="Jump back to footnote 14 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:antibiotics">
<p>Very few new antibiotic mechanisms have been discovered in recent decades, so the evolution of resistance is rapidly outstripping the development of new tools. Things are made worse by horizontal gene transfer, mediated by the environment. A similar effect occurs with pesticide resistance, but antibiotics are much more essential to health care, most medical operations are impossible without effective antibiotics. And without antibiotics people would again die from what are now minor, treatable infections. This is not even some far-fetched future scenario, it is already happening. Tech optimists have set their hopes on AI to enable the development of new antibiotic mechanisms. But even if this comes to pass, the problem is only delayed, not solved. This is an often overlooked aspect of &ldquo;narrative fallacy&rdquo;: mistaking reality for a story, in which we finally overcome the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; for good. Human narratives require an ending, but real life does not. Evolutionary adaptation is a continuous process, which is precisely why life has been so successful.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:antibiotics" title="Jump back to footnote 15 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:performativity">
<p>The fact that a narrative can act as a self-fulfilling prophecy is signified as <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performativity#Economics_and_finance">performativity</a></em> by social scientists. This is the concept that language can function as a form of social action (e.g. determining norms, conventions or expectations) and have the effect of change (e.g. other people conforming their behaviour).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:performativity" title="Jump back to footnote 16 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:capitalism">
<p>Capitalism is a strange beast, in the sense that it requires the future to be both open and to some degree predictable. Openness is required for opportunity to occur. If the future were known, there could be no innovation and competition, so risk-taking occupies a central role in Capitalism. At the same time, the dependency on credit systems requires that financial risk cannot be the same as uncertainty: we must be able to <em>calculate</em> risk. Credit allows firms to make investments using resources they have yet to earn through future success. Because success is far from guaranteed, debtors have to pay interest on their loans, and the payment of interest requires economic expansion. The credit system therefore both requires and enforces economic growth, at least on average. But all this only works if risks are perceived to be manageable.   <br>
To create the illusion that the future can be known to some extent, economists use a trick: They replace true uncertainty (which is unknowable per definition) by statistical risk (which can be estimated), and they simply ignore true uncertainty in their predictions. This makes future risk seem manageable. But calculation of risks is only possible if the future is (mostly) similar to the past, something which cannot really be guaranteed when we&rsquo;re talking about human behaviour!   <br>
Moreover, Capitalism <em>as a system</em> requires change (often in the form of &ldquo;creative destruction&rdquo;) to stay healthy. But the same isn&rsquo;t true for individual people and firms. Newcomers in the economy may have a lot to gain by taking risks and changing the playing field. Established firms and (and many individuals) on the other hand have a lot to lose, and will probably prefer to minimise risks and resist changes to economic or social structures. This often <em>includes</em> resistance to true innovation, because its effects are impossible to predict.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:capitalism" title="Jump back to footnote 17 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:uncertainty">
<p><em>uncertainty may feel uncomfortable, but it is necessary.</em>   <br>
I do not mean this as a metaphor: uncertainty often literally feels uncomfortable and threatening. Many people resort to wishful thinking and far-fetched explanations (e.g. conspiracy theories) rather than face uncertainty. But we can train ourselves to accept a certain degree of uncertainty (and ignorance) without feeling threatened or afraid.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:uncertainty" title="Jump back to footnote 18 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:identitypolitics">
<p><em>Propaganda often aims to sell us a single narrative of what the future will be like. It aims to suppress uncertainty and to vilify competing narratives.</em>   <br>
This is what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics">identity politics</a> aims to do, especially in its populist form.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:identitypolitics" title="Jump back to footnote 19 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:lossaversion">
<p><em>stories of Decline tap into negative feelings such as fear, they are most effective at grabbing and holding our attention.</em>   <br>
One of the underlying cognitive biases is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion">loss aversion</a>.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:lossaversion" title="Jump back to footnote 20 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:ancientcycles">
<p>We can name some examples of stability (growth/decline) cycles, including ancient Sumer, Egypt, China (all of which existed for millennia, and arguably the Chinese empire never ended). Mention Turchin&rsquo;s work, point out that social instability and resource limitations limit the success-periods in all societies (which require internal stability and cooperation and/or aggressive expansion in the case of military extractive empires, such as the Roman Empire or more recently the European colonial empires).
China is an interesting example, due to its clear cycles of flourishing/integration and instability/fragmentation, reflected in its long written history. It shows that &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; is relative, and in the case oof China it was never total. Periods of flourishing involved central coordination, economic success and (often oppressive) power wielded by a strong state. Decline often resulted from a combination of coordination and power breaking down, e.g. due to internal factors such as the death of an emperor, corruption, internal conflict between rival elite factions and peasant revolts, external factors such as foreign pressure and natural disaster and systemic dynamics intertwined with everything, such as economic recession. The history of empires shows another pattern: violence and oppression may lead to stability for a while, but it can never be permanently maintained and its negative side-effects are many. In the end all large empires collapsed and nearly all major cities were destroyed.<br>
Mention recency bias and the fact that large-scale violence as well as prosperity in complex societies have been around for a long time (with differences in scale, technology, etc, but still). Also mention that history demonstrates the role of change quite well, most armies that went into battle expected to win, and the actual victors were certainly not always the biggest or even strongest armies.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ancientcycles" title="Jump back to footnote 21 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:moralregression">
<p><em>Successful collective action requires [&hellip;] a shared motivational force, which is usually provided by &ldquo;righteous anger&rdquo; at some moral issue. The second ingredient is efficacy, the feeling that we can do something about the moral issue in question. This is how social change happens, it is the motor behind our moral progress in the past.</em>   <br>
Unfortunately this is also the motor behind moral regressions, such as lynch mobs or ethnic cleansing. One issue is that different groups emphasise different moral values. This is why it is important that group values explicitly include human core values that are as universal as possible. Another issue is that anger is a very powerful motivational force, but it is not always the best response to a situation and it can easily evoke violence. This is why emotional regulation is an important skill that we should take seriously and that, ideally, every child (and adult) should learn. Like most aspects of human behaviour, both collective action and emotion are not inherently good or bad, they can lead to positive or negative outcomes.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:moralregression" title="Jump back to footnote 22 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
